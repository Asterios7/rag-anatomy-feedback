         "4 Tissue Level of Organization\n4.2 Connective Tissue\n4.2d Classification of Connective Tissue\n----------\n\nThe connective tissue types present after birth are classified into three \nbroad categories: connective tissue proper,  supporting connective \ntissue, and fluid connective tissue. Figure 4.9 provides an overview \nof these tissue types and the subcategories within them, each of which \nis described in detail next.\n Connective Tissue Proper\n Connective tissue proper includes those types of connective tissue \nthat exhibit a variable mixture of both connective tissue cell types \nand extracellular protein fibers suspended within a viscous ground \nsubstance. These connective tissue types differ with respect to their \nnumbers and types of cells and the relative properties and proportions \nof their fibers and ground substance.\n Cells of Connective Tissue Proper Two classes of cells \nform the connective tissue proper: resident cells and wandering \ncells (table 4.5). Resident cells are stationary cells permanently \ncontained within the connective tissue. They help support, main\ntain, and repair the extracellular matrix. Wandering cells continu\nously move throughout the connective tissue and are involved in \nimmune protection and repair of damaged extracellular matrix. The \nnumber of wandering cells at any given moment varies depending \non local conditions.\n The resident cells of the connective tissue proper include the \nfollowing types:\n ■ Fibroblasts (fī′brō-blast; fibra = fiber, blastos = germ) are \nlarge, relatively flat cells with tapered ends. They are the \nmost abundant resident cells in connective tissue proper. They \n produce the fibers and ground substance components of the \nextracellular matrix.\n ■ Adipocytes (ad′i-pō-sīt; adip = fat) are also called fat cells. \nThey often appear in small clusters within some types of \nconnective tissue proper. If a larger cluster of these cells \ndominates an area, the connective tissue is called adipose \nconnective tissue.\n ■ Fixed macrophages (mak′rō-fāj; makros = large, phago = to \neat) are relatively large, irregular-shaped cells with numerous \nsurface folds and projections. They are derived from one type \nof leukocyte (called a monocyte) and dispersed throughout the \nextracellular matrix, where they phagocytize damaged cells \nor pathogens. When the fixed macrophages encounter foreign \nmaterials, the cells release chemicals that stimulate the immune \nsystem and lure numerous wandering cells involved in body \ndefense to the foreign materials.\n Form antibodies that bind to foreign substances, bacteria, viruses\n Phagocytize foreign materials\n Attack foreign materials (lymphocytes) or directly combat bacteria \n(neutrophils)\n that synthesize disease-fighting proteins called antibodies \n(an′tē-bod′ē; anti = against, bodig = corpus). Usually, plasma \ncells are found in the intestinal walls, spleen, and lymph \nnodes.\n ■ Free macrophages. These mobile, phagocytic cells are formed \nfrom monocytes (a type of white blood cell) that migrate out of \nthe bloodstream. They wander through connective tissue and \nengulf and destroy any bacteria, foreign particles, or damaged \ncells and debris they encounter.\n ■ Other leukocytes. In addition to the leukocytes just mentioned, \nother leukocytes migrate through the blood vessel walls into \nthe connective tissue where they spend most of their time. The \nmajority of these leukocytes are neutrophils, a type of white \nblood cell that seeks out and phagocytizes bacteria. The rest \nare lymphocytes, which attack and destroy foreign materials.\n ■ Mesenchymal cells are a type of embryonic stem cell \ncontained within connective tissue. As a result of local injury \nor connective tissue damage, mesenchymal stem cells divide. \nOne of the cells produced is the replacement mesenchymal \ncell, and the other becomes a committed cell that moves into \nthe damaged or injured area and differentiates into the type of \nconnective tissue cell that is needed.\n The wandering cells of the connective tissue proper are primar\nily types of leukocytes (lū′kō-sīt; leukos = white), also called white \nblood cells. As you will learn in greater detail in section 21.3b, there \nare several different types of leukocytes, and each type performs cer\ntain functions that help us overcome illness or fight foreign invaders \nin our bodies. Connective tissue proper contains specific types of \nwandering cells, including the following:\n ■ Mast cells. These small, mobile cells contain a granule-filled \ncytoplasm. They are usually found close to blood vessels; they \nsecrete heparin to inhibit blood clotting, and histamine to dilate \nblood vessels and increase blood flow.\n ■ Plasma cells. When B-lymphocytes (a type of white blood  \ncell) are activated by exposure to foreign materials, the cells \nbecome plasma cells. These cells are small “factories”  \nProtein Fibers of Connective Tissue Proper As mentioned previ\nously, the three types of protein fibers in connective tissue proper are \ncollagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Fibroblasts synthesize \nthe components of all three fiber types, and then secrete these protein \nsubunits into the interstitial fluid. The subunits combine or aggregate \nwithin the matrix and form the completed fiber.\n Collagen (kol′lă-jen; koila = glue, gen = producing) fibers are \nlong, unbranched, “cablelike” extracellular fibers composed of the \nprotein collagen. They are strong, flexible, and resistant to stretching. \nCollagen forms about 25% of the body’s protein, making it the most \nabundant protein in the body. In fresh tissue, collagen fibers appear \nwhite, and thus they are often called white fibers. In tissue sections \nstained with hematoxylin and eosin to give contrast, they appear \npink. The parallel structure and arrangement of collagen bundles in \ntendons and ligaments allows them to withstand enormous forces in \none direction.\n Elastic (ē-las′tik; elastreo = drive) fibers contain the protein \nelastin and are thinner than collagen fibers. They stretch easily, \nbranch, rejoin, and appear wavy. The coiled structure of elastin \nallows it to stretch and recoil like a rubber band when the deform\ning force is withdrawn. Elastic fibers permit the skin, lungs, and \narteries to return to their normal shape after being stretched. Fresh \nelastic fibers have a yellowish color and are called yellow fibers. \nIn tissue sections, elastic fibers are visible only when stained with \nspecial stains, such as Verhoff stain, which makes elastic fibers \nappear black.\n Reticular (re-tik′yū-lăr; reticulum = small net) fibers are \nthinner than collagen fibers. They contain the same protein subunits \nthat collagen has, but their subunits are combined in a different way \nand they are coated with a glycoprotein (a protein with some carbo\nhydrate attached to it). These fibers form a branching, interwoven \nframework that is tough but flexible. Reticular fibers are especially \nabundant in the stroma, a structural connective tissue framework in \norgans such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. The meshlike ar\nrangement of the reticular fibers permits them to physically support \norgans and resist external forces that may damage the organ’s cells \nand blood vessels.\n Ground Substance of Connective Tissue Proper The cel\nlular and fibrous components of the connective tissue proper are \nsuspended within the ground substance, a colorless, featureless, \nviscous solution. Ground substance usually has a gelatinous, almost \nrubbery consistency due to the mixture of its component molecules, \nwhich vary both in their size and in their proportions of proteins \nand carbohydrates. The different molecules in the ground substance \nare called glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and structural glyco\nproteins. Note that this viscous ground substance is not static. Fluid, \nmolecules, and cells constantly travel through this material as they \nmove among cells, blood vessels, and lymph vessels.\n Categories of Connective Tissue Proper\n Connective tissue proper is divided into two broad categories: loose \nconnective tissue and dense connective tissue (table 4.6). This classi\nfication is based upon the relative proportions of cells, protein fibers, \nand ground substance.\n Loose Connective Tissue Loose connective tissue contains \nrelatively fewer cells and protein fibers than dense connective \ntissue. The protein fibers in loose connective tissue are loosely \narranged rather than tightly packed together. Usually, this tissue \nProvides great strength and flexibility \nprimarily in a single direction\n Provides tensile strength in all \ndirections\n Provides framework and supports \norgans\n Stroma of spleen, liver, lymph nodes, bone \nmarrow\n Tendons and ligaments\n Dermis of skin; capsules of organs\n Walls of large arteries\n occupies the spaces between and around organs. Loose connec\ntive tissues support the overlying epithelia and provide cushioning \naround organs, support and surround blood vessels and nerves, \nstore lipids, and provide a medium for the diffusion of materials. \nThus, loose connective tissues act as the body’s “packing material.” \nThere are three types of loose connective tissue: areolar connective \ntissue, adipose connective tissue, and reticular connective tissue.\n Areolar (ă-rē′ō-lăr) connective tissue is highly variable in \nappearance and the least specialized connective tissue in the body \n(table 4.7a). It has a loosely organized array of collagen and elastic \nfibers and an abundant distribution of blood vessels. Areolar connec\ntive tissue contains all of the cell types of connective tissue proper, \nalthough the predominant cell is the fibroblast. A viscous ground \nsubstance occupies the spaces between fibers and accounts for most \nof the volume of areolar connective tissue. The ground substance \ncushions shocks, and the loosely organized fibers ensure that this \ntype of connective tissue can be distorted without damage. Addition\nally, the elastic properties of this tissue promote independent move\nments. For instance, under the dermis of the skin is a superficial \nlayer of areolar connective tissue, thus tugging on the skin of the leg, \nfor example, does not affect the underlying muscle.\n Areolar connective tissue is found nearly everywhere in the \nbody. It surrounds nerves, blood vessels, and individual muscle cells. It \nis also a major component of the subcutaneous layer deep to the skin.\n Adipose connective tissue (commonly known as fat) is a loose \nconnective tissue composed primarily of cells called adipocytes \n(table 4.7b). Adipocytes (white fat) usually range from 70 μm to \n120 μm in diameter. In life, adipocytes are filled with one lipid \ndroplet. On a histology slide, the lipid has been extracted dur\ning preparation, so all that is left is the plasma membrane of the  \nadipocyte, with the nucleus pushed to the side of a round, clear space \nlooking much like a ring.\n Adipose connective tissue serves as packing around structures \nand provides padding, cushions shocks, and acts as an insulator \nto slow heat loss through the skin. Adipose connective tissue is \ncommonly found throughout the body in such diverse locations as a fat \ncapsule surrounding the kidney, the pericardial and abdominopelvic  \ncavities, and the subcutaneous layer.\nFat is a primary energy store for the body. The amount of \nstored fat fluctuates as the adipose cells either increase their amount \nof stored fat (called lipogenesis) or decrease their amount of stored \nfat (called lipolysis). But although there is a constant turnover of \nthe stored fat, an equilibrium is usually reached, and the amount of \nstored fat and the number of adipocytes are normally quite stable in \nan individual. Although adipocytes cannot divide, mesenchymal cells \ncan provide additional fat cells if the body has excess nutrients. Thus, \neven after a surgical procedure to reduce the amount of body fat, such \nas liposuction, the mesenchymal stem cells may replace adipocytes to \nstore excess fat in the body.\n Reticular connective tissue contains a meshwork of reticular \nfibers, fibroblasts, and leukocytes (table 4.7c). This connective tissue \nforms the stroma of many lymphatic organs, such as the spleen, thy\nmus, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. \nDense Connective Tissue Dense connective tissue is composed \nprimarily of protein fibers and has proportionately less ground \nsubstance than does loose connective tissue. Dense connective tissue \nis sometimes called collagenous tissue because collagen fibers are \nthe dominant fiber type. There are three categories of dense connec\ntive tissue: (1) dense regular connective tissue, (2) dense irregular \nconnective tissue, and (3) elastic connective tissue.\n Dense regular connective tissue has collagen fibers that are \npacked tightly and aligned parallel to an applied force (table 4.8a). \nThis tissue type is found in tendons and ligaments, where stress is \napplied in a single direction. Dense regular connective tissue has few \nblood vessels, and thus it takes a long time to heal following injury, \nbecause a rich blood supply is necessary for good healing.\n In dense irregular connective tissue, individual bundles of \ncollagen fibers extend in all directions in a scattered meshwork. \nThese bundles of collagen fibers appear in clumps throughout the \ntissue, rather than arranged in parallel as seen in dense regular con\nnective tissue (table 4.8b). Dense irregular connective tissue provides \nsupport and resistance to stress in multiple directions.\n An example of dense irregular connective tissue is the \ndeep portion of the dermis, which lends strength to the skin and \npermits it to withstand applied forces from any direction. Dense \nirregular connective tissue also forms a supporting layer around \ncartilage (called the perichondrium) and around bone (called the \nperiosteum), except at joints. In addition, it forms a thick, fibrous \ncapsule that supports and houses internal organs, such as the liver, \nkidneys, and spleen.\n Elastic connective tissue has branching elastic fibers and more \nfibroblasts than loose connective tissue in addition to packed collagen \nfibers (table 4.8c). The elastic fibers provide resilience and the ability \nto deform and then return to normal shape. Examples of structures \ncomposed of elastic connective tissue are the vocal cords, the suspen\nsory ligament of the penis, and some ligaments of the spinal column. \nElastic connective tissue also is present as wavy sheets in the walls \nof large and medium arteries.\n Supporting Connective Tissue\n Cartilage and bone are types of supporting connective tissue because \nthey form a strong, durable framework that protects and supports the \nsoft body tissues. The extracellular matrix in supporting connec\ntive tissue contains many protein fibers and a ground substance that \nranges from semisolid to solid. In general, cartilage has a semisolid \nextracellular matrix, and bone has a solid extracellular matrix.\n Cartilage Cartilage has a firm, gel-like extracellular matrix com\nposed of both protein fibers and ground substance. Mature cartilage \n cells are called chondrocytes (kon′drō-sīt; chondros = gristle or \ncartilage, cytos = a hollow [cell]). They occupy small spaces called \nlacunae (lă-kū′nē; lacus = a hollow, a lake), within the extracellular \nmatrix. The physical properties of cartilage vary with the  extracellular  \nmatrix contents. Cartilage is stronger and more resilient than any \npreviously discussed connective tissue type, and it provides more \nflexibility than bone. Collagen fibers within the matrix give cartilage \nits tensile strength; its resilience is attributed to elastic fibers and \nvariations in the kinds and amounts of ground substance compo\nnents, including water.\n Cartilage is found in areas of the body that need support and \nmust withstand deformation, such as the tip of the nose or the external \npart of the ear (auricle).\n Chondrocytes produce a chemical that prevents blood vessel \nformation and growth within the extracellular matrix. Thus, mature \ncartilage is avascular, meaning without blood vessels. Therefore, \nthe chondrocytes must exchange nutrients and waste products with \nblood vessels outside of the cartilage by diffusion. Cartilage usu\nally has a covering called the perichondrium (per′i-kon′drē-ŭm;  \nperi = around). Two distinct layers form the perichondrium: an outer, \nfibrous region of dense irregular connective tissue and an inner, cel\nlular layer. The fibrous layer provides protection and mechanical \nsupport, and secures the perichondrium to the cartilage and to other \nstructures. The cellular layer contains stem cells (chondroblasts) nec\nessary for the growth and maintenance of the cartilage.\n Types of Cartilage Three major types of cartilage occur in the body: \nhyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and elastic cartilage. The cartilage \ntypes exhibit differences in density and dispersal of chondrocytes within \nthe extracellular matrix.\n Hyaline (hī′ă-lin, -lēn; hyalos = glass) cartilage is the most \ncommon type of cartilage and also the weakest. It provides its support \nthrough flexibility and resilience. Hyaline cartilage is surrounded by \nperichondrium. It is named for its clear, glassy appearance under the \nmicroscope. The chondrocytes within their lacunae are irregularly \nscattered throughout the extracellular matrix (table 4.9a). However, \nthe collagen within the matrix is not readily seen by light microscopy. \nIf the hyaline cartilage tissue is stained by hematoxylin and eosin and \nthen examined with light microscopy, the tissue resembles carbon\nated grape soda, where the lacunae represent the bubbles in the soda.\n Hyaline cartilage has many functions in addition to its primary \none of supporting soft tissue. It forms most of the fetal skeleton and \nis a model for most future bone growth. The cartilage at the articular \nends of long bones allows the bones in a joint to move freely and \neasily. Hyaline cartilage is found in many other areas of the body, \nincluding the nose, trachea, most of the larynx, costal cartilage (the \ncartilage attached to the ribs), and the articular ends of long bones.\n Fibrocartilage (fi′brō-kar′ti-lăj; fibro = fiber) has numerous \ncoarse, readily visible fibers in its extracellular matrix (table 4.9b). \nThe fibers are arranged as irregular bundles between large chondro\ncytes. There is only a sparse amount of ground substance, and often \nthe chondrocytes are arranged in parallel rows. The densely interwo\nven collagen fibers contribute to the extreme durability of this type \nof cartilage. It has no perichondrium because stress applied at the \nsurface of the fibrocartilage would destroy this tissue layer.\n Fibrocartilage is found in the intervertebral discs (circular \nstructures between adjacent vertebrae), the pubic symphysis (a \npad of cartilage between the anterior parts of the pelvic bones), \nand the menisci (C-shaped cartilage pads) of the knee joint. In \nthese  locations, fibrocartilage acts as a shock absorber and resists \n compression.\n Elastic cartilage is so named because it contains numerous \nelastic fibers in its matrix (table 4.9c). The higher concentration \nof elastic fibers in this cartilage causes it to appear yellow in fresh \nsections. The chondrocytes of elastic cartilage are almost indistin\nguishable from those of hyaline cartilage. They are typically closely \n packed and surrounded by only a small amount of extracellular \nmatrix. The elastic fibers are both denser and more highly branched \nin the central region of the extracellular matrix, where they form a \nweblike mesh around the chondrocytes within the lacunae. These \nfibers ensure that elastic cartilage is extremely resilient and flexible. \nElastic cartilage is surrounded by a perichondrium.\n Elastic cartilage is found in the epiglottis (a structure in the \nlarynx that prevents swallowed food and fluids from entering the \ntrachea) and in the external ear. You can see for yourself how flexible \nelastic cartilage is by performing this experiment: Fold your external \near over your finger, hold for 10 seconds, and release. You will notice \nthat your ear springs back to its original shape because the elastic\n cartilage resists the deformational pressure you applied. (This also \nexplains why our ears aren’t permanently misshapen if we sleep on \nthem in an unusual way!)\n Bone Bone connective tissue (or osseous connective tissue) \nmakes up the mass of most of the body structures referred to as \n “bones.” Bone is more solid than cartilage and provides greater sup\nport. Section 6.3 provides a detailed description of the histology of \nbone connective tissue.\n About one-third of the dry weight of bone is composed \nof organic components (collagen fibers and different protein\ncarbohydrate molecules), and two-thirds consists of inorganic \ncomponents (a mixture of calcium salts, primarily calcium phos\nphate). Bone derives its remarkable properties from its  combination \nof components: Its organic portions provide some flexibility and \ntensile strength, and its inorganic portions provide compressional \nstrength. The minerals are deposited onto the collagen fibers, \nresulting in a structure that is strong and durable but not brittle. Al\nmost all bone surfaces (except for the surfaces of the joints of long \nbones) are covered by a dense irregular connective tissue called \nthe periosteum (per′ē-os′tē-ŭm; osteon = bone), which is similar \nto the perichondrium of cartilage.\n There are two forms of bone connective tissue: compact \nbone and spongy bone. Both types are typically found in all bones \nof the body. Compact bone appears solid but is in fact perforated \nby a number of vascular canals. It usually forms the hard outer \nshell of the bone. Spongy bone (or cancellous bone) is located \nwithin the interior of a bone. Instead of being completely solid, \nspongy bone contains spaces, and the bone connective tissue \nforms a latticework structure that is very strong, yet lightweight. \nThis design allows our bones to be both strong and lightweight at \nthe same time.\n Compact bone has an ordered histologic pattern (table 4.10). \nIt is formed from cylindrical structures called osteons, or Haversian \nsystems. Osteons run parallel to the shafts of long bones. Each osteon \ncontains concentric rings of bone called lamellae (lă-mel′ē; lamina =  \nplate), which encircle a central canal (Haversian canal). Blood ves\nsels and nerves travel through the central canals of osteons. Lacunae \nbetween neighboring concentric lamellae house bone cells, called \nosteocytes (os′tē-ō-sīt). Diffusion of nutrients and waste products \ncannot occur through the hard matrix of bone, so osteocytes must \ncommunicate with one another, and ultimately with the blood ves\nsels in the central canal, through minute passageways in the matrix \ncalled canaliculi (kan-ă-lik′yū-lī; canalis = canal). Together, all of \nthe canaliculi form a branching network throughout compact bone \nfor the exchange of materials between the blood vessels and the os\nteocytes within the lacunae.\n Bone serves a variety of functions. Bones provide levers for \nmovement when the muscles attached to them contract, and they \nprotect soft tissues and vital body organs. The hard matrix of bone \nstores important minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus. Finally, \nmany areas of spongy bone contain hematopoietic (hē′ma-tō-poy\net′ik; hemat = blood) cells, which form reticular connective tissue \nthat is responsible for producing blood cells (a process called hema\ntopoiesis). Thus, the connective tissue that produces our blood cells \nis stored within our spongy bone.\n Fluid Connective Tissue\n There are two types of fluid connective tissue: blood and lymph. \nBlood is a fluid connective tissue composed in part of cells and \ncell fragments called formed elements. These formed elements are \nerythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), and \nplatelets (table 4.11). The erythrocytes transport oxygen and car\nbon dioxide between the lungs and the body tissues, while some \nleukocytes mount an adaptive immune response and others respond \nto foreign pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. \nPlatelets are involved in blood clotting.\n\n Besides the formed elements, blood contains dissolved protein \nfibers in a watery ground substance. Together, the dissolved protein \nfibers and the watery ground substance form an extracellular matrix \ncalled plasma. Plasma transports nutrients, wastes, and hormones \nthroughout the body. Lymph is derived from blood plasma and is \nreturned to the blood. As it has no formed elements, it is not shown \nhistologically in table 4.11. Blood and lymph are discussed in greater \ndetail in chapter 21 and section 24.2, respectively. \n\n\n\n### Table 4.4 Types of Embryonic Connective Tissue \n| Feature   | (a) Mesenchyme | (b) Mucous Connective Tissue |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| Structure | Ground substance is a viscous gel with some immature protein fibers; mesenchymal cells are stellate or spindle-shaped | Mesenchymal cells scattered within a viscous, gel-like ground substance; immature protein fibers present |\n| Function  | Common origin for all other connective tissue types | Support of structures in umbilical cord attaching fetus to mother |\n| Location  | Throughout the body of the embryo, fetus, and adult | Umbilical cord of fetus |\n\n### Table 4.7 Connective Tissue Proper: Loose Connective Tissue\n|| Feature   | (a) Areolar Connective Tissue | (b) Adipose Connective Tissue | (c) Reticular Connective Tissue |\n|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Structure | Abundant vascularized ground substance is gel-like; scattered fibroblasts; many blood vessels | Closely packed adipocytes (fat cells); nucleus squeezed to one side by large fat droplet | Ground substance is gel-like liquid; scattered arrangement of reticular fibers, fibroblasts, and leukocytes |\n| Function  | Surrounds and protects tissues and organs; loosely binds epithelia to deeper tissues; provides nerve and blood vessel packing | Stores energy; protects, cushions, and insulates | Provides supportive framework for spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow |\n| Location  | Papillary layer of dermis, subcutaneous layer under skin; surrounds organs | Subcutaneous layer; covers and surrounds some organs | Forms stroma of spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow |\n\n### Table 4.8  Connective Tissue Proper: Dense Connective Tissue\n| Feature   | (a) Dense Regular Connective Tissue | (b) Dense Irregular Connective Tissue | (c) Elastic Connective Tissue |\n|-----------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Structure | Densely packed, parallel collagen fibers; fibroblast nuclei squeezed between layers of fibers; scarce ground substance | Predominantly collagen fibers, randomly arranged and clumped together; fibroblasts in spaces among fibers; more ground substance than in dense regular connective tissue | Predominantly freely branching elastic fibers; fibroblasts occupy some spaces between fibers |\n| Function  | Attaches muscle to bone and bone to bone; resists stress applied in one direction | Withstands stresses applied in all directions; durable | Allows stretching of some organs |\n| Location  | Tendons, most ligaments | Dermis; periosteum covering bone; perichondrium covering cartilage; organ capsules | Walls of elastic arteries; trachea; bronchial tubes; true vocal cords; suspensory ligaments of penis |\n\n### Table 4.9 Supporting Connective Tissue: Cartilage\n| Feature   | (a) Hyaline Cartilage | (b) Fibrocartilage | (c) Elastic Cartilage |\n|-----------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Structure | Glassy-appearing matrix; lacunae house chondrocytes; usually covered by perichondrium | Readily visible, parallel collagen fibers in matrix; lacunae house chondrocytes; no perichondrium | Contains abundant elastic fibers; elastic fibers form weblike mesh around lacunae; perichondrium present |\n| Function  | Smooth surfaces for movement at joints; model for bone growth; supports soft tissue | Resists compression; absorbs shock in some joints | Maintains structure and shape while permitting extensive flexibility |\n| Location  | Covers articular ends of long bones; most of fetal skeleton; costal cartilage; most of the larynx, trachea, nose | Intervertebral discs; pubic symphysis; menisci of knee joints | External ear; epiglottis of the larynx |\n\n### Table 4.10 Supporting Connective Tissue: Bone\n| Feature   | Bone |\n|-----------|------|\n| Structure | Compact bone: Calcified matrix arranged in osteons (concentric lamellae arranged around a central canal containing blood vessels); Spongy bone: Lacks the organization of compact bone; contains macroscopic spaces; bone arranged in a meshwork pattern |\n| Function  | Supports soft structures; protects vital organs; provides levers for movement; stores calcium and phosphorus.

         "7 Axial Skeleton\n7.1 Skull\n7.1c Bones of the Cranium\n----------\n\n\nThe eight bones of the cranium collectively form a rigid protective \nstructure for the brain. The cranium consists of a roof and a base. The \nroof, called the calvaria (kal-vā′rē-ă), or skullcap, is composed of the \nsquamous part of the frontal bone, the parietal bones, and the squa\nmous part of the occipital bone. The base of the cranium is composed \nof portions of the ethmoid, sphenoid, occipital, and temporal bones. \nSome skulls in the anatomy lab have had their calvariae cut away, mak\ning the distinction between the calvaria and base easier to distinguish. \nEach bone of the cranium has specific surface features (table 7.2).\n Frontal Bone\n The frontal bone forms part of the calvaria, the forehead, and the \nroof of the orbits (figure 7.10). During development, the cranial bones \n(including the frontal bone) form as a result of the fusion of separate \nossification centers, an event that may not occur until after birth. The \nfrontal bone is formed from two major, separate  ossification centers. \nSoon after birth, the left and right sides of the developing frontal bone \nare united by the metopic (me-top′ik; metopon = forehead) suture. \nThis suture usually fuses and disappears by age 2, although a trace \nof it persists in some adult skulls.\n The squamous part of the frontal bone is the vertical flattened \nregion. The squamous part ends at the supraorbital margins, each of \nwhich forms the superior ridge of the orbit. The midpoint of each supra\norbital margin contains a single supraorbital foramen, or notch. Su\nperior to the supraorbital margins are the superciliary  (sū′pĕr-sil′ē-ār′ē; \nsuper = above, cilium = eyelid) arches, which are the brow ridges. \nMale skulls tend to have more pronounced superciliary arches than \ndo female skulls. The part of the frontal bone sandwiched between \nthe superciliary arches is the glabella (glă-bel′ă; glabellus = smooth).\n The orbital part of the frontal bone is the smooth, inferior \nportion that forms the roof of the orbit. Lateral to each orbital part is \nthe zygomatic process of the frontal bone, which articulates with the \nfrontal process of the zygomatic bone.\n Within the frontal bone is a pair of frontal sinuses (see \nfigure 7.9). The frontal sinuses usually start to appear after age 6 \nand become more fully developed after age 10. Some people never \ndevelop these sinuses at all.\n On the internal surface of the frontal bone is a midline eleva\ntion of bone called the frontal crest. The frontal crest serves as a \npoint of attachment for the falx cerebri, a protective connective tissue \nsheet that helps support the brain (see section 15.2a).\n Parietal Bones\n The right and left parietal (pă-rī′ĕ-tăl; paries = wall) bones form the \nlateral walls and roof of the cranium (figure 7.11). Each parietal bone \nis bordered by four sutures that unite it to the neighboring bones. A \nparietal foramen sometimes occurs in the posterior one-third of the \nparietal bone, adjacent to the sagittal suture. A tiny emissary vein \ntravels through this opening, connecting the venous sinuses with the \nveins of the scalp. On the lateral surface, each parietal bone exhibits \na pair of faint ridges called the superior and inferior temporal lines. \nThese lines arc across the surface of the parietal and frontal bones. \nThey mark the attachment site of the large, fan-shaped temporalis \nmuscle that closes the mouth. Superior to these lines, the rounded, \nsmooth parietal surface is called the parietal eminence. The internal \nsurfaces of the parietal bones exhibit many grooves that accommo\ndate some of the blood vessels within the cranium.\n Temporal Bones\n The paired temporal bones form the inferior lateral walls and part \nof the floor of the cranium (figure 7.12). Each temporal bone has a \ncomplex structure composed of three parts: the petrous, squamous, \nand tympanic parts.\n The thick petrous (pet′rŭs; patra = a rock) part of the tem\nporal bone houses sensory structures of the inner ear that provide \ninformation about hearing and balance. In figure 7.12b, observe the \ninternal acoustic meatus (mē-ā′tŭs; a passage) (also called either the \ninternal auditory meatus, or internal auditory canal). It provides a \npassage way for nerves and blood vessels to and from the inner ear \n(see section 19.6c). A groove for the sigmoid (sig′moyd; sigma = the \nletter S, eidos = resemblance) sinus runs along the inferior surface \nof the  petrous region. The sigmoid sinus is a venous sinus (vein) that \ndrains blood from the brain (see section 23.3c).\n Externally, the prominent bulge on the inferior surface of the \ntemporal bone is the mastoid (mas′toyd; masto = breast) process, an \nanchoring site for muscles that move the neck. Rather than being solid \nbone, it is filled with many small, interconnected air cells (called \nmastoid air cells) that communicate with the middle ear.\n On the posteroinferior surface of the temporal bone, a mastoid \nforamen may be present near the mastoid process. Tiny emissary veins \ntravel through this foramen to connect the venous sinuses inside the \ncranium with the veins on the scalp. A thin, pointed projection of bone, \ncalled the styloid (stī′loyd; stylos = pillar post) process, serves as an \nattachment site for several hyoid and tongue muscles. The stylomastoid \nforamen lies between the mastoid process and the styloid process (see \nfigure 7.8). The facial nerve (CN VII) extends through the stylomastoid \nforamen to innervate the facial muscles (see section 15.8). The carotid \ncanal (ka-rot′id; karoo = to put to sleep) is medial to the styloid process \nand transmits the internal carotid artery (see section 23.3c).\n\nThe squamous part, or squama, is the lateral flat surface of \nthe temporal bone immediately inferior to the squamous suture (see \nfigure 7.12). Immediately inferior to the squamous part, a prominent \nzygomatic (zī′gō-mat′ik; zygoma = a joining, a yoke) process curves \nlaterally and anteriorly to unite with the temporal process of the \nzygomatic bone. The union of these processes forms the zygomatic \narch (see figures 7.6 and 7.8). Each temporal bone articulates with \nthe mandible inferior to the base of both zygomatic processes in a \ndepression called the mandibular (man-dib′yū-lăr) fossa. Anterior \nto the mandibular fossa is a bump called the articular tubercle.\n Immediately posterolateral to the mandibular fossa is the  \ntympanic (tim-pan′ik; tympanon = drum) part, a small, bony ring \nsurrounding the entrance to the external acoustic meatus, or exter\nnal auditory canal (see figure 7.12).\n Occipital Bone\n The occipital bone is subdivided into a flattened squamous part, \nwhich forms the posterior region of the skull, and a median basilar \npart, which forms a portion of the base of the cranium (figure 7.13). \nWithin the basilar part of the occipital bone is a large, circular \n187\n opening called the foramen magnum, and lateral to this foramen are \nsmooth knobs called occipital (ok-sip′i-tăl; occiput = back of head) \ncondyles. The skull articulates with the first cervical vertebra at the \noccipital condyles. When you nod “yes,” you are moving the occipi\ntal condyles against the vertebra. At the anteromedial edge of each \ncondyle is a hypoglossal canal through which the hypoglossal nerve \n(CN XII) extends to supply the tongue muscles (see section 15.8). \nPosterior to each occipital condyle is a variable condylar canal, \nwhich transmits a vein.\n Some prominent ridges appear on the external surface of the \noccipital bone. The external occipital crest projects in a posterior \ndirection from the foramen magnum, ending in the external  occipital \nprotuberance (prō-tū′bĕr-ăns). Intersecting the external occipital \ncrest are two horizontal ridges, the superior and inferior nuchal \n(nŭ′kăl) lines. These ridges are attachment sites for ligaments and \nneck muscles (see section 11.1g).\n The portion of the occipital bone that helps form the jugular \nforamen is called the jugular notch (figure 7.13b). The concave \ninternal surface of the occipital bone closely follows the contours \nof the brain. Additionally, there are impressions named for the\n venous sinuses within the cranium. For example, the groove for \nthe  superior sagittal sinus, the groove for the transverse sinus, \nand a portion of the groove for the sigmoid sinus represent the \nimpressions that the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, and \nsigmoid sinus make on the internal surface of the occipital bone, \nrespectively (see section 23.3c). Also on the internal surface of \nthe occipital bone, at the junction of the left and right grooves for \nthe transverse sinuses, is the internal occipital protuberance. \nAn internal occipital crest extends from the protuberance to the \nposterior border of the foramen magnum. This crest is a site of at\ntachment for the falx cerebelli, a connective tissue sheet that helps \nsupport the cerebellum of the brain (see section 15.2a).\n Sphenoid Bone\n The sphenoid (sfē′noyd; wedge-shaped) bone has a complex shape, \nresembling that of a butterfly (figure 7.14). It is often referred to as \na “bridging bone,” or the “keystone of the skull,” because it unites \nthe cranial and facial bones and articulates with almost every other \nbone of the skull (figure 7.15). Medially, it has a thick body, which \ncontains the sphenoidal sinuses. Laterally, it extends to form the \ngreater and lesser wings. Although the sphenoid is relatively large, \nmuch of it is hidden by more superficial bones.\n The pituitary gland (see section 20.3) is suspended inferiorly \nfrom the brain into a prominent midline depression between the \ngreater and lesser wings. This depression is termed the hypophyseal \nfossa, and the bony enclosure around the hypophyseal fossa is called \nthe sella turcica (sel′ă, saddle; tur′si-kă, Turkish) (see figure 7.14). \nThe sella turcica houses the pituitary gland. On either side of the sella \nturcica are projections called the anterior clinoid (klī′noyd; kline = \nbed) processes and the posterior clinoid processes. The anterior \nborder of the sella turcica is formed by the tuberculum sellae; the \nposterior border is formed by the dorsum sellae.\n Anterior to the sella turcica, a shallow, transverse depression \ncalled the optic (op′tik; ops = eye) groove crosses the superior sur\nface of the sphenoid bone. An optic canal (or foramen) is located at \neither end of this groove. The optic nerves (CN II) that carry visual \ninformation from the eyes to the brain travel through these canals \n(see section 15.8). On either side of the sella turcica, the foramen \nrotundum (rō-tŭn′dum; round), the foramen ovale (ō-văl′ē; oval), \nand the foramen spinosum (spĭ-nō′sŭm) penetrate the greater wings \nof the sphenoid bone. These openings transmit blood vessels to the \nmeninges around the brain and nerves to structures of the orbit, face, \nand jaws. A pterygoid canal is located on either side of the body \nand transmits a nerve. The  pterygoid (ter′i-goyd; pteryx = winglike) \nprocesses are vertical projections that begin at the boundary between \nthe greater and lesser wings. Each pterygoid process forms a pair of \nmedial and lateral pterygoid plates, which provide the attachment \nsurfaces for some muscles that move the lower jaw and soft palate \n(see section 11.1c).\n Ethmoid Bone\n The irregularly shaped ethmoid (eth′moyd; ethmos = sieve) bone is \npositioned between the orbits (figure 7.15). It forms the anteromedial \nfloor of the cranium, the roof of the nasal cavity, part of the medial \nwall of each orbit, and part of the nasal septum.\n The superior part of the ethmoid bone exhibits a thin mid\nsagittal elevation called the crista (kris′tă; crest) galli (gal′lē; cock) \n(figure 7.16). This bony crest is the point of attachment for the falx \ncerebri, a membranous sheet that helps support the brain (see section \n15.2a). Immediately lateral to each side of the crista galli, the horizon\ntal cribriform (krib′ri-fōrm; cribrum = sieve) plate has  numerous \nperforations called the cribriform foramina. These foramina provide \npassageways for the olfactory nerves (CN I) (see section 15.8).\n The paired ethmoidal labyrinths (lateral masses) contain \ntiny spaces called the ethmoidal sinuses, which open into both \nsides of the nasal cavity. The smooth part of each ethmoidal \nlabyrinth is called the orbital plate, and forms part of the me\ndial wall of the orbit. The ethmoidal labyrinths are partially \ncomposed of thin, scroll-like bones called the superior and the \nmiddle nasal conchae (kon′kē; sing., concha, kon′kă; shell). \nThe inferior, midline projection of the ethmoid bone is called \nthe perpendicular plate, and forms the superior part of the \nnasal septum.\n Cranial Fossae\n The contoured floor of the cranial cavity exhibits three curved \ndepressions called the cranial fossae (figure 7.17). Their surfaces \ncontain depressions for parts of the brain, grooves for blood vessels, \nand numerous foramina.\n The anterior cranial fossa is the shallowest of the three \ndepressions. It is formed by the frontal bone, the ethmoid bone, \nand the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. The anterior cranial \nfossa houses the frontal lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. It \nranges from the internal surface of the inferior part of the frontal \nbone (anteriorly) to the posterior edge of the lesser wings of the \nsphenoid bone (posteriorly).\n\nThe middle cranial fossa is inferior and posterior to the \nanterior cranial fossa. It ranges from the posterior edge of the \nlesser wings of the sphenoid bone (anteriorly) to the anterior part \nof the petrous part of the temporal bone (posteriorly). This fossa \nis formed by the parietal, sphenoid, and temporal bones. It houses \nthe temporal lobes of the cerebral hemispheres and part of the \nbrainstem.\n The posterior cranial fossa is the most inferior and poste\nrior cranial fossa. It extends from the posterior part of the petrous \npart of the temporal bones to the internal posterior surface of the \nskull. The posterior fossa is formed by the occipital, temporal, and \nparietal bones. This fossa houses the cerebellum and part of the \nbrainstem.\n\n\n### Table 7.2 Cranial Bones and Selected Features\n| **Bone(s) and Associated Passageways** | **Bone Boundaries Within the Skull** | **Selected Features and Their Functions** |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Frontal bone** | Supraorbital foramen | Forms superior and anterior parts of skull, part of anterior cranial fossa and orbit<br>• Frontal crest: Attachment site for meninges to help stabilize brain<br>• Frontal sinuses: Lighten bone, moisten inhaled air, give resonance to voice<br>• Orbital part: Forms roof of orbit<br>• Squamous part: Attachment of scalp muscles<br>• Supraorbital margin: Forms protective superior border of orbit |\n| **Parietal bones** | Parietal foramina | Each forms most of lateral and superior walls of skull<br>• Inferior and superior temporal lines: Attachment site for temporalis muscle<br>• Parietal eminence: Forms rounded prominence on each side of skull |\n| **Temporal bones** | Carotid canal, External acoustic meatus, Internal acoustic meatus, Mastoid foramen, Stylomastoid foramen, Jugular foramen (with occipital bone) | Forms inferolateral wall of skull, part of middle cranial fossa; three parts—petrous, squamous, tympanic<br>• Mandibular fossa: Articulates with mandible<br>• Mastoid air cells: Lighten mastoid process<br>• Mastoid process: Attachment for neck muscles to extend/rotate head<br>• Petrous part: Protects sensory structures in inner ear<br>• Styloid process: Attachment for hyoid ligaments/muscles<br>• Squamous part: Attachment for jaw muscles<br>• Zygomatic process: Articulates with zygomatic bone to form zygomatic arch |\n| **Occipital bone** | Foramen magnum, Hypoglossal canal, Jugular foramen (with temporal bone) | Forms posteroinferior skull, posterior cranial fossa, part of skull base<br>• External occipital crest: Attachment for ligaments<br>• External occipital protuberance: Muscle attachment<br>• Inferior and superior nuchal lines: Attachment for neck ligaments/muscles<br>• Occipital condyles: Articulate with atlas (C1) |\n| **Sphenoid bone** | Foramen lacerum (with temporal & occipital bones), Foramen ovale, Foramen rotundum, Foramen spinosum, Optic canal, Superior orbital fissure | Forms part of skull base, posterior orbit, anterior & middle cranial fossae<br>• Body: Houses sphenoidal sinuses<br>• Sella turcica: Houses pituitary gland<br>• Optic canals: House optic nerves (CN II)<br>• Medial & lateral pterygoid plates: Attachment for mastication muscles<br>• Lesser wings: Part of anterior cranial fossa; contain optic canal<br>• Greater wings: Part of middle cranial fossa & orbit<br>• Sphenoidal sinuses: Lighten bone, moisten air, give voice resonance |\n| **Ethmoid bone** | Cribriform foramina | Forms part of anterior cranial fossa, nasal septum, roof & lateral walls of nasal cavity, medial orbit wall<br>• Crista galli: Attachment for cranial dural septa to stabilize brain<br>• Ethmoidal labyrinths: Contain ethmoidal sinuses and nasal conchae<br>• Ethmoidal sinuses: Lighten bone, moisten air, give voice resonance<br>• Nasal conchae (superior & middle): Increase airflow turbulence for cleaning/moistening air<br>• Orbital plate: Forms part of medial orbit wall<br>• Perpendicular plate: Forms superior nasal septum |\n",

         "7 Axial Skeleton\n7.4 Vertebral Column\n7.4c Vertebral Anatomy\n----------\n\nMost vertebrae share common structural features (figure 7.29). The \nanterior region of each vertebra is a rounded or cylindrical body, \nalso called a centrum (pl., centra), which is the weight-bearing \nstructure of almost all vertebra. Posterior to the vertebral body is the \nvertebral arch, also called the neural arch. Together, the vertebral \narch and the body enclose a roughly circular opening called the \nvertebral foramen. Collectively, all the stacked vertebral foramina \nform a superior-to-inferior directed vertebral canal that contains \nthe spinal cord. Lateral openings between adjacent vertebrae are \nthe intervertebral (in′tĕr-ver′tĕ-brăl) foramina. The intervertebral \nforamina provide a horizontally directed passageway through which \nspinal nerves travel to other parts of the body (see section 16.4).\n The vertebral arch is composed of two pedicles and two \nlaminae. The pedicles (ped′ī-kĕl; pes = foot) originate from \nthe posterolateral margins of the body, whereas the laminae \n(lam′i-nē; sing., lamina, lam′i-nă; layer) extend posteromedially \nfrom the posterior edge of each pedicle. A spinous process pro\njects posteriorly from the left and right laminae. Most of these \nspinous processes can be palpated through the skin of the back. \nLateral projections on both sides of the vertebral arch are called \ntransverse processes.\n Each vertebra has articular processes on both its superior and \ninferior surfaces that project from the junction between the pedicles \nand laminae. The inferior articular processes of each vertebra \narticulate with the superior articular processes of the  vertebra im\nmediately inferior to it. Each articular process has a smooth surface, \ncalled an articular facet (fas′et, fă-set′). The angles of these facets \ndiffer along the length of the vertebral column contributing to differ\nent movements along the vertebral column.\n The vertebral bodies are interconnected by ligaments. \nAdjacent vertebral bodies are separated by pads of fibrocarti\nlage called the intervertebral discs. Intervertebral discs are \ncomposed of an outer ring of fibrocartilage, called the anulus  \nfibrosus (an′ū-lŭs f  ī-brō′sŭs), and an inner circular region, called \nthe nucleus pulposus. The nucleus pulposus has a high water con\ntent, giving it a gelatinous consistency. Intervertebral discs make up \nabout one-quarter of the entire vertebral column. They act as shock \nabsorbers between the vertebral bodies, and also allow the vertebral \n column to bend. For example, when you bend your torso anteriorly, \nthe intervertebral discs are compressed at the bending (anterior) \nsurface and pushed out toward the opposite (posterior) surface.\n Intervertebral discs are able to withstand a certain amount of \ncompression. Over the course of a day, as body weight and grav\nity act on the vertebral column, the intervertebral discs become \ncompressed and flattened. But while a person sleeps, lying hori\nzontally, the intervertebral discs are able to spring back to their \noriginal shape.\n In general, the vertebrae are smallest near the skull, and be\ncome gradually larger moving inferiorly through the body trunk as \nweight bearing increases. Thus, the cervical vertebrae are the small\nest, followed by the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae. Also, the \nvertebral foramen is largest in the cervical vertebrae and smallest in \nthe sacral vertebrae. \nAlthough vertebrae are divided into regions, there are no \nanatomically discrete “cutoffs” between the regions. For example, \nthe most inferior cervical vertebra has some structural similarities \nto the most superior thoracic vertebra, as the two vertebrae are ad\njacent to one another. Likewise, the most inferior thoracic vertebra \nmay look similar to the first lumbar vertebra. Despite this, there are \nbasic characteristics that distinguish different types of vertebrae. \nWe discuss these characteristics in the next sections. Table 7.5 \ncompares the characteristics of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar \nvertebrae.\n Cervical Vertebrae\n The cervical vertebrae, C1–C7, are the most superiorly placed verte\nbrae (table 7.5a). They extend inferiorly from the occipital bone of \nthe skull through the neck to the thorax. Because cervical vertebrae \nsupport only the weight of the head, their vertebral bodies are rela\ntively small and light.\n The body of a typical cervical vertebra (C3–C6) is relatively \nsmall compared to its foramen. The superior surface of a cervical \nvertebral body is concave from side to side, and it exhibits a supe\nrior slope from the posterior edge to the anterior edge. The spinous \nprocess is relatively short, usually less than the diameter of the \nvertebral foramen. The tip of each process, other than C7, is usually \nbifurcated (bifid), meaning that the posterior end of the spinous pro\ncess appears to be split in two. The transverse processes of the first \nsix (and sometimes the seventh) cervical vertebrae are unique in that \nthey contain prominent, round transverse foramina, which provide \na protective bony passageway for the vertebral arteries and veins \nsupplying the brain.\n The head is a large, heavy structure that is precariously bal\nanced upon the cervical vertebrae. Small muscles keep the head \nstable. However, if the body changes position suddenly—for example, \ndue to a fall or the impact from a car crash—these “balancing” mus\ncles cannot stabilize the head. A cervical dislocation called whiplash \nmay result, characterized by injury to muscles and ligaments and \npotential injury to the spinal cord.\n Atlas (C1) The first cervical vertebra, called the atlas (at′las), sup\nports the head via its articulation with the occipital condyles of the \n occipital bone. This vertebra is named for the Greek mythological \nfigure Atlas, who carried the world on his shoulders. The articula\ntion between the occipital condyles and the atlas, called the atlanto\noccipital joint, permits us to nod our heads “yes.” The atlas is readily \ndistinguished from the other vertebrae because it lacks a body and \na spinous process. Instead, the atlas has lateral masses that are con\nnected by semicircular anterior and posterior arches, each containing \nslight protuberances, the anterior and posterior tubercles (tū′bĕr-kĕl) \n(figure 7.30a). The atlas has depressed, oval superior articular facets \nthat articulate with the occipital condyles of the skull. The atlas also \nhas inferior articular facets that articulate with the superior articular \nfacets of the axis. Finally, the atlas has an articular facet for dens on \nits anterior arch where it articulates with the dens of the axis. \nAxis (C2) During development, the body of the atlas fuses to \nthe body of the second cervical vertebra, called the axis (ak′sis) \n( figure 7.30b). This fusion produces the most distinctive feature of \nthe axis, the prominent dens, or odontoid (ō-don′toyd; odont = tooth) \nprocess. The dens rests in the articular facet for dens of the atlas, \nwhere it is held in place by a transverse ligament. The dens acts as a \npivot for the rotation of both the atlas and the skull. This articulation \nbetween the atlas and axis, called the atlantoaxial joint, permits us \nto shake our heads “no” (figure 7.30c).\n Because both the dens and the spinal cord occupy the vertebral \nforamen at the level of the axis, any trauma that dislocates the dens \noften results in severe injury. For example, an impact to the head  or \neven severe shaking of a child can dislocate the dens and cause severe \ndamage to the spinal cord. In an adult, a severe blow at or near the \nbase of the skull is often equally dangerous because dislocation of the \natlantoaxial joint can force the dens into the base of the brain, with \nfatal results. \nVertebra Prominens (C7) The seventh cervical vertebra repre\nsents a transition to the thoracic vertebral region and has some \nfeatures of thoracic vertebrae. The spinous process of C7 is \ntypically not bifurcated, and it is much larger and longer than \nthe spinous processes of the other cervical vertebrae. This large \nspinous process is easily discerned and palpated through the skin, \nsometimes appearing as a slight protrusion between the shoulder \nblades and inferior to the neck (see section 13.4c). Thus, C7 is \ncalled the vertebra prominens (prom′i-nens; prominent). If you \ndrop your head forward (place your chin to your chest) and run \nyour fingers down the back of your neck, it is the first bony lump \nyou feel. \nThoracic Vertebrae\n There are 12 thoracic vertebrae, designated T1–T12, and each \nvertebra articulates with the ribs (table 7.5b). The thoracic vertebrae \nlack the mobility of the other vertebrae due to their stabilizing artic\nulation with the ribs. The thoracic vertebrae also lack the transverse \nforamina and bifid spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae, but \nthey have their own distinctive characteristics. A thoracic vertebra \nhas a heart-shaped body that is larger and more massive than the \nbody of a cervical vertebra. Its spinous process is relatively pointed \nand long; in some thoracic vertebrae, it angles sharply in an inferior \ndirection.\n Thoracic vertebrae are distinguished from all other types of \nvertebrae by the presence of costal facets or costal demifacets \n(dem′ē; half) on the lateral side of the body and on the sides of the \ntransverse processes. A costal facet is a circular depression that \narticulates with the entire head or tubercle of the rib, and a costal \ndemifacet is a semicircular depression that articulates with either the \nsuperior or inferior edge of the head of the rib. The head of the rib \narticulates with the costal facet on the body of the thoracic vertebra. \nThe tubercle of the rib articulates with the costal facets on the trans\nverse processes of the vertebra.\n The thoracic vertebrae vary slightly in terms of their trans\nverse costal facets. Vertebrae T1–T10 have transverse costal facets \non their transverse processes; T11 and T12 lack these transverse \ncostal facets because the eleventh and twelfth ribs do not have \n tubercles (and thus do not articulate with the transverse processes). \nThe costal facets on the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae also dis\nplay variations:\n ■ The body of vertebra T1 bears a full costal facet for the first rib \nand a demifacet for the second rib.\n ■ The bodies of vertebrae T2–T8 have two demifacets each: one \non the superior edge of the body, and the other on the inferior \nedge of the body.\n ■ The body of vertebra T9 has only a superior demifacet for the \narticulation with the ninth rib.\n ■ The bodies of vertebrae T10–T12 have a single whole facet to \narticulate with their respective ribs. \nLumbar Vertebrae\n The largest vertebrae are the lumbar vertebrae, and they bear most \nof the weight of the body. A typical lumbar vertebra body is thicker \nthan those of all the other vertebrae, and its superior and inferior \nsurfaces are oval or round, rather than heart-shaped (table 7.5c). \nThe lumbar vertebrae are distinguished by the features they \nlack: A lumbar vertebra has neither transverse foramina nor costal \nfacets. The transverse processes are thin and project dorsolaterally. \nThe spinous processes are thick and project posteriorly, unlike the \nthoracic vertebrae spinous processes, which are long, slender, and \npoint posteroinferiorly.\n\nSacrum\n The sacrum is an anteriorly curved, somewhat triangular bone \nthat forms the posterior wall of the pelvic cavity. The apex of the \nsacrum is a narrow, pointed portion of the bone that projects in\nferiorly, whereas the bone’s broad superior surface forms its base. \nThe lateral sacral curvature typically is more pronounced in males \nthan in females.\n The sacrum is composed of the five fused sacral vertebrae  \n(figure 7.31). These vertebrae start to fuse shortly after puberty and \nare usually completely fused between ages 20 and 30. The horizon\ntal lines of fusion that remain are called transverse ridges. Superi\norly, the sacrum articulates with L5 via a pair of superior articular  \nprocesses, and inferiorly it articulates with the  coccyx. The vertebral \ncanal becomes much narrower and continues through the sacrum as the \nsacral canal. The sacral canal terminates in an inferior opening called the \nsacral hiatus (hī-ā′tŭs; hio = to yawn). The sacral hiatus represents an \narea where the laminae of the last sacral vertebra failed to fuse. On either \nside of the sacral hiatus are bony projections called the sacral cornua.\n The anterosuperior edge of the first sacral vertebra bulges \nanteriorly into the pelvic cavity and is called the promontory. Four \nanterior lines cross the anterior surface of the sacrum, marking the \nlines of fusion of the sacral vertebrae. The paired anterior sacral \nforamina permit the passage of nerves to the pelvic organs. A dorsal \nridge, termed the median sacral crest, is formed by the fusion of the \nspinous processes of individual sacral vertebrae. Also on the dorsal \nsurface of the sacrum are four pairs of openings for spinal nerves, \ncalled the posterior sacral foramina. On each lateral surface of  \nthe sacrum is the ala (meaning “wing”). On the lateral surface  \nof the ala is the auricular surface, which marks the site of ar\nticulation with the os coxae of the pelvic girdle, forming the strong \nsacroiliac (sā′krō-il′ē-ak) joint (see section 9.5c).\n\n Coccyx\n Four small coccygeal vertebrae fuse to form the coccyx \n(figure 7.31a). The individual vertebrae begin to fuse by about \nage 25. The coccyx is an attachment site for several ligaments \nand some muscles. The first and second coccygeal vertebrae \nhave unfused vertebral arches and transverse processes. The \nprominent laminae of the first coccygeal vertebrae are known \nas the coccygeal cornua, which curve to meet the sacral cor\nnua. Fusion of the coccygeal vertebrae is not complete until \nadulthood. In males, the coccyx tends to project anteriorly, \nbut in females it tends to project more inferiorly, so as not to  \nobstruct the birth canal. In very old individuals, the coccyx may \nfuse with the sacrum\n\n WHAT DID YOU LEARN?\n ●12 Draw a typical vertebra.

         "2 The Cell: Basic Unit of Structure and Function\n2.3 Plasma Membrane\n2.3c Transport Across the Plasma Membrane\n----------\n\nAs we’ve just discussed, the plasma membrane is selectively \npermeable, so it is able to regulate transport of materials into \nand out of the cell. The following factors influence membrane \npermeability:\n ■ Transport proteins. These integral membrane proteins \nmove specific molecules across the membrane. Some of these \nproteins are called carrier proteins.\n ■ Plasma membrane structure. Characteristics of the \nmembrane phospholipids affect the ability of some molecules \nto cross that membrane. For example, some small polar \nmolecules such as water are able to interact and pass \nthrough the phospholipids in the bilayer, whereas other polar \nmolecules, such as simple sugars, cannot.\n ■ Concentration gradient. Materials move more rapidly when \ntheir concentrations are significantly different between two \ncompartments. For example, if intracellular fluid has a low \nconcentration of a permeable substance, and the extracellular \nfluid has a high concentration of that substance, it would pass \nmore quickly through the membrane into the cell.\n ■ Ionic charge. An ion (atom with a net negative or positive \ncharge) may either be repulsed or attracted to the membrane \nstructures, influencing rate of molecular movement across \nthe membrane. For example, if the inside of the cell has a \nnet negative charge, a negative ion might be repelled by the \nintracellular environment, whereas a positive ion might be \nattracted to the intracellular environment.\n ■ Lipid solubility. Materials that are lipid-soluble readlily \npass through the membrane. For example, small nonpolar \nmolecules called fatty acids move through the hydrophobic \ninterior of the phospholipid bilayer and enter the cytoplasm \nof the cell, whereas larger, charged polar molecules, such as \nsimple sugars or amino acids, are prevented from moving \nthrough the plasma membrane.\n ■ Molecular size. Smaller molecules move across the plasma \nmembrane readily, whereas larger molecules need special \ntransport systems to move them across the membrane.\n\n Passive Transport\n The processes of transporting substances across plasma membranes \nare classified as either passive or active. Passive transport moves \nsubstances across a plasma membrane without the expenditure of \nenergy by the cell. Materials move along a concentration gradient, \nmeaning that they flow from a region of higher concentration of \nthe material to a region of lower concentration. Passive transport is \nsimilar to floating downstream with the current; no cellular energy \n(ATP) is needed for it to occur. Passive processes that move mate\nrial across the plasma membrane include simple diffusion, osmosis, \nfacilitated diffusion, and bulk filtration.\n\nSimple Diffusion Diffusion (di-fyū′zhŭn; diffundo = to pour in \ndifferent directions) is the tendency of molecules to move down their \nconcentration gradient; that is, the molecules move from a region of \nhigher concentration to a region of lower concentration. This move\nment continues until the molecules are spread out evenly on each side \nof the membrane. The concentration of these molecules is now said \nto be at equilibrium.\n Simple diffusion occurs when substances move across mem\nbranes unaided because they are either small, nonpolar, or both. As \na result of simple diffusion, a net movement of specific molecules \nor ions takes place from a region of their higher concentration to a \nregion of their lower concentration. This net movement continues \nuntil all of those molecules are evenly distributed in the environ\nment (the point of equilibrium). At this point, the concentration \ngradient no longer exists. However, molecular movement does not \ncease. Those molecules still move continuously in all directions at \nan equal rate. For example, there is no net movement of molecule \n“A” during its equilibrium, which means that one molecule “A” \nenters the cell for every molecule “A” that leaves the cell. An ex\nample of diffusion in the body is the movement of respiratory gases \nbetween the air sacs in the lungs and the blood vessels in the lungs. \nOxygen continually moves from the lung air sacs into the blood, \nwhereas carbon dioxide moves in the opposite direction. This move\nment guarantees that the blood will receive oxygen and eliminate \ncarbon dioxide as part of normal respiration. The process of simple \ndiffusion can occur without the presence of a membrane. Thus, it \nalso occurs within the cell to distribute substances throughout the \ncytoplasm. \n\nOsmosis Osmosis (os-mō′sis; osmos = a thrusting) is a special \ntype of simple diffusion in which water diffuses from one side of \nthe selectively permeable membrane to the other. The net movement \nof water across a semipermeable membrane continues from a region \nof high water concentration to a region of low water concentration \nuntil equilibrium is established. In the body, the movement of water \nbetween the blood and the extracellular fluid around cells occurs by \nosmosis. \n\nFacilitated Diffusion Facilitated diffusion requires the parti\ncipation of transport proteins that help specific substances move \nacross the plasma membrane. These substances are either large \nmolecules or molecules that are insoluble in lipids. The molecule \nto be moved binds to the transport protein in the membrane. This \nbinding helps alter the shape of both the transport protein and \nthe molecule to be moved, thus permitting it to pass through the \nmembrane. For example, glucose and some amino acids move \nacross the membrane by this means. Facilitated diffusion differs \nfrom simple diffusion in that a specific protein is required to aid \ntransport.\n\nBulk Filtration Bulk filtration, or bulk movement, involves the \ndiffusion of solvents and solutes together across the selectively per\nmeable membrane. Solvents are liquids that have substances called \nsolutes dissolved within them. For example, water is a solvent if a \nsolute such as salt or sugar is dissolved in it. Bulk filtration occurs \nwhen fluid and certain solutes are transported from the blood into \nChapter Two The Cell \nthe extracellular fluid. It works in this way: Hydrostatic pressure \n(hī′drō-stat′ik presh′ŭr) (fluid pressure exerted by blood pushing \nagainst the inside wall of a blood vessel) forces both water and \nsmall solutes from the blood across the plasma membranes of cells \nlining the capillaries (the smallest type of blood vessel). Only \nsmaller molecules (glucose) and ions (such as sodium [Na+] and \npotassium [K+]) can be forced across the membrane by hydrostatic \npressure. The largest molecules (called macromolecules) and large \nsolid particles in the solvent must be transported through the mem\nbrane by the process of active transport, which we examine next.\n\nActive Transport\n Active transport is the movement of a substance across a plasma \nmembrane against a concentration gradient, so materials must be \nmoved from an area of low concentration to an area of high concen\ntration. It is similar to swimming upstream against a current, where \nyou must exert energy (swim) to move against the water flow. To \nmove materials against their concentration gradient, active transport \nrequires cellular energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) \nand sometimes a transport protein as well. ATP is continually syn\nthesized by mitochondria, cell structures described in section 2.4c. \nActive transport methods include ion pumps and several processes \ncollectively known as bulk transport.\n\n Ion Pumps Active transport mechanisms that use transport pro\nteins to move ions across the membrane are called ion pumps. Ion \npumps are a major factor in a cell’s ability to maintain its internal \nconcentrations of ions. One type of ion pump is the sodium\npotassium pump. This transport mechanism is an example of \nan exchange pump, because it moves one ion type into the cell  \nand simultaneously removes another type of ion from the cell  \n(figure 2.5). For example, compared to their extracellular fluid, \nsome human cells have much higher concentrations of potassium \nions and much lower concentrations of sodium ions. The plasma \nmembrane uses the sodium-potassium pump to maintain these \nsteep concentration gradient differences by continuously removing \nsodium ions from the cell and moving potassium ions into the cell. \nFigure 2.5 shows how the cell expends energy in the form of ATP \nto maintain these sodium and potassium levels.\n\n Bulk Transport Macromolecules, such as large proteins and \npolysaccharides, cannot move across the plasma membrane via \nion pumps or with the assistance of normal transport proteins. \nInstead, larger molecules or bulk structures move across the \nmembrane via the active transport processes called exocytosis \nand endocytosis.\n In exocytosis (ek′sō-sī-tō′sis; exo = outside, kytos = a hollow \n[cell], osis = condition of), large molecules are secreted from the \ncell (figure 2.6). Typically, the material for secretion is packaged \nwithin intracellular transport vesicles (ves′i-kăl; vesica = bladder), \nwhich move toward the plasma membrane. When the vesicle and \nplasma membrane come into contact, the lipid molecules of the \nvesicle and plasma membrane bilayers rearrange themselves so \nthat the two membranes fuse. The fusion of these lipid bilayers \nrequires the cell to expend energy in the form of ATP. Following \nfusion, the vesicle contents are released to the outside of the cell. \nAn example of this process occurs in the pancreas, where cells \nrelease digestive enzymes into a pancreatic duct for transport to \nthe small intestine.\n By contrast, large particulate substances and macromolecules \nare taken into the cell via endocytosis (en′dō -sī-tō′sis; endon = within).\nThe steps of endocytosis are similar to those of exocytosis, only in \nreverse. In endocytosis, extracellular macromolecules and large par\nticulate matter are packaged in a vesicle that forms at the cell surface \nfor internalization into the cell. A small area of plasma membrane  \nfolds inward to form a pocket, or invagination (in-vaj′i-nā′shŭn;  \nin = in, vagina = a sheath), which deepens and pinches off as the lipid \nbilayer fuses. This fusion of the lipid bilayer is the energy-expending \nstep. A new intracellular vesicle is formed containing material that \nwas formerly outside the cell. There are three types of endocyto\nsis: phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis \n(figure 2.7).\n\nPhagocytosis (fag′ō -sī-tō′sis; phago = to eat, kytos = a hollow \n[cell], osis = condition) means “cellular eating.” It is a nonspecific \nprocess that occurs when a cell engulfs or captures a large particle ex\nternal to the cell by forming membrane extensions, called pseudopodia \n(sing., pseudopodium; sū′dō-pō′dē-ŭm, -pō′dē-ă; pous = foot), or \nfalse feet, to surround the particle (figure 2.7a). Once the particle \nis engulfed by the pseudopodia, it is packaged within an enclosed \nmembrane sac. If large enough, this sac is classified as a vacuole \n(vak′yū-ōl; vacuum = an empty space). The contents of the vacuole \nare broken down chemically (digested) after it fuses with a lysosome \n(lī′sō-sōm; lysis = a loosening, soma = body), which contains \nspecific digestive enzymes that split large molecules into smaller \nones. Only a few types of cells are able to perform phagocytosis. \nFor example, phagocytosis occurs regularly when a white blood cell \nengulfs and digests a bacterium\n\nPinocytosis (pin′ō-sī-tō′sis [or pī′nō-]; pineo = to drink, kytos =  \na hollow [cell], osis = condition) is known as “cellular drinking.” \nThis process occurs when the cell internalizes a very small droplet \nof extracellular fluid into tiny internal vesicles (figure 2.7b). This \nprocess is nonspecific because all solutes dissolved in the droplet are \ntaken into the cell. Most cells perform this type of transport across \nthe membrane. Pinocytosis is similar to bulk filtration in that both \ntypes of transport move similar materials. However, it differs from \nbulk filtration because pinocytosis moves materials against a con\ncentration gradient. An example of pinocytosis occurs within cells \nthat form a capillary (tiny blood vessel) wall, where vesicles fill with \na fluid droplet containing small solutes from the blood, carry this \ndroplet to the other side of the cell, and then expel its contents outside \nthe capillary wall.\n\n Receptor-mediated endocytosis is the movement of specific \nmolecules from the extracellular fluid into a cell by way of a newly \nformed vesicle. This process begins when molecules in the extra\ncellular fluid bind to their specific integral membrane protein \nreceptors. (Recall that a membrane receptor is a protein that acts \nas a binding site for molecules outside the cell.) This process is dif\nferent from the nonspecific transport mechanisms discussed earlier \nin this section. It is considered a specific mechanism because the \nendocytosis is stimulated by the binding of the specific molecules \nto their specific membrane receptors. The receptor proteins then \ncluster in one region of the membrane to begin the process of en\ndocytosis. The plasma membrane housing the bound specific mol\necules from the extracellular fluid folds inward to form a pocket, \nor invagination (figure 2.7c). This membrane pocket deepens and \npinches off as the lipid bilayers fuse. The fusion of these lipid bi\nlayers requires the cell to expend energy in the form of ATP. An \nexample of receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs when human cells \ncontain receptors that bind to and internalize cholesterol, which is \nrequired for new membrane synthesis. Cholesterol travels in our \nblood bound to proteins called low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). \nLDL particles bind to LDL receptors in the membrane. Receptor\nmediated endocytosis enables the cell to obtain bulk quantities of \nspecific substances, even though those substances may not be very \nconcentrated in the extracellular fluid.\n\n\n### Table 2.3 Transport Processes Across a Plasma Membrane\n| Process | Type of Movement | Energy Source | Example |\n|---------|-----------------|---------------|---------|\n| **PASSIVE TRANSPORT** | Movement of substance along a concentration gradient; ATP not required |  |  |\n| Simple diffusion | Unaided net movement of a substance due to molecular motion down its concentration gradient across selectively permeable membrane; continues until equilibrium is reached | Molecular movement | Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between blood and body tissues |\n| Osmosis | Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane; direction is determined by relative solute concentrations; continues until equilibrium is reached | Molecular movement | Water in small kidney tubules moves across a cell barrier back into the blood from the tubular fluid that eventually forms urine |\n| Facilitated diffusion | Movement of materials too large to pass through membrane channels; relies on transport proteins | Molecular movement requiring carrier assistance by a transport protein | Transport of glucose into cells |\n| Bulk filtration | Bulk movement of solvents and solutes from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration as a result of hydrostatic pressure differences across the membrane | Hydrostatic pressure | Transport of nutrients and fluids from the blood into body tissues |\n| **ACTIVE TRANSPORT** | Movement of substances against a concentration gradient; requires ATP; requires assistance to move across the membrane, often by a transport protein and sometimes by bulk movement in vesicles |  |  |\n| Ion pumps | Transport of ions across the membrane against a concentration gradient by transmembrane protein pumps | ATP | Sodium-potassium pump |\n| Bulk transport | Membrane vesicles form around materials for transport; consists of two types (exocytosis and endocytosis) | ATP |  |\n| Exocytosis | Bulk movement of substances out of the cell by fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane | ATP | Release of digestive enzymes by pancreatic cells |\n| Endocytosis | Bulk movement of substances into a cell by vesicles forming at the plasma membrane; consists of three types (phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis) | ATP |  |\n| Phagocytosis | Type of endocytosis in which particulate materials move into a cell after being engulfed by pseudopodia at the cell surface; vesicles form at the inside of the plasma membrane; large sacs are called vacuoles | ATP | White blood cell engulfs a bacterium |\n| Pinocytosis | Type of endocytosis in which plasma membrane folds inward to capture extracellular fluid droplet and its dissolved contents, forming a small new vesicle inside the cell | ATP | Formation of small vesicles in capillary wall to move fluid and small particulate materials out of the blood |\n| Receptor-mediated endocytosis | Type of endocytosis in which specific molecule-receptor complexes in the plasma membrane stimulate the clustering of bound molecule-receptor complexes; vesicles containing specific molecules bound to receptors in the membrane stimulate internalization of the bound molecules | ATP | Uptake of cholesterol into cells |",

         "2 The Cell: Basic Unit of Structure and Function\n2.4 Cytoplasm\n2.4c Organelles\n----------\n\n Organelles (or′găn-el; organon = organ, elle = the diminutive suf\nfix), meaning “little organs,” are complex, organized structures with \nunique, characteristic shapes. Each type of organelle performs a dif\nferent function for the cell. Collectively, the specialized functions of \nall organelles are essential for normal cellular structure and activities. \nThese unique structures permit the cell to carry on different activities \nsimultaneously. This division of labor prevents interference between \ncellular activities and promotes maximal functional efficiency in \nthe cell. Organelles assume specific roles in growth, repair, and \ncellular maintenance. Different cell types vary in organelle distribu\ntion and numbers, depending on the cell function. Two categories \nof organelles are recognized: membrane-bound organelles and non\nmembrane-bound organelles.\n\n Membrane-Bound Organelles\n Some organelles are surrounded by a membrane and thus are called \nmembrane-bound organelles, or membranous organelles. This \nmembrane is similar to the plasma membrane surrounding the \ncell in that it is composed of a phospholipid bilayer with diverse \nassociated proteins. Every membrane exhibits a unique protein-lipid\n composition, which confers a unique function(s) to that membrane. \nThe membrane separates the organelle’s contents from the cytosol \nso that the activities of the organelle can proceed without disrupting \nother cellular activities. Membrane-bound organelles include the en\ndoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, peroxisomes, \nand mitochondria.\n\nEndoplasmic Reticulum The endoplasmic reticulum (re-tik′yū\nlŭm; rete = net) (ER) is an extensive intracellular membrane network \nthroughout the cytoplasm. ER is composed of two distinct regions that \ndiffer in structure and function: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth \nER, or SER) and rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER, or RER; \nfigure 2.8). The amount of either kind of ER varies, depending upon the \nspecific functions of the cell.\n\nSmooth ER is continuous with the rough ER. Smooth ER \nwalls do not have the rough appearance of rough ER, because \nthere are no ribosomes attached to the membranes. Smooth \nER resembles multiple interconnected branches of tubules. The \nsmooth ER of various cell types functions in diverse metabolic \nprocesses, including synthesis, transport, and storage of lipids; \nmetabolism of carbohydrates; and detoxification of drugs, alcohol, \nand poisons. The amount of smooth ER is greater in cells that syn\nthesize steroid hormones. In addition, the liver contains abundant \namounts of smooth ER to process digested nutrients and detoxify \ndrugs and alcohol.\n\nRough ER is responsible for producing, transporting, and \nstoring proteins associated with a membrane. Rough ER consists \nof parallel membranes enclosing spaces called cisternae (sis-ter′nă; \ncisterna = cistern). Ribosomes are the small structures attached \nto the cytoplasmic sides (called faces) of these membranes. These \nribosomes are called bound ribosomes because they are attached \nto the membrane surface of the ER, thus forming the rough ER. \nThese ribosomes synthesize the proteins targeted for cell export, \ninsertion into the plasma membrane, or inclusion within a lysosome \nas a catalyst. As new proteins are synthesized by the bound ribo\nsomes, they pass through the membrane of the rough ER and enter \nits cisternae, where their original structure changes by either adding \nother molecules or removing part of what was originally synthe\nsized. These modified proteins are packaged into small, enclosed \nmembrane sacs that pinch off from the ER. These sacs, termed \ntransport vesicles, shuttle proteins from the rough ER to another \norganelle, the Golgi apparatus (discussed later in this section), for \nfurther modification. For a seamless interaction and transition \nbetween organelles, transport vesicles, and the plasma membrane, \nthe membranes of each structure have the same general lipid and \nprotein composition and organization. The amount of rough ER is \ngreater in cells producing large amounts of protein for secretion, \nsuch as a cell in the pancreas that secretes enzymes for digesting \nmaterials in the small intestine.\n\nGolgi Apparatus The Golgi apparatus, also called the Golgi \ncomplex, is a center for modifying, packaging, and sorting materials that \narrive from the rough ER in transport vesicles. The Golgi apparatus is \nespecially extensive and active in cells specialized for secretion.\n The Golgi apparatus is composed primarily of a series of cis\nternae, which are arranged in a stack (figure 2.9a). The edges of each \nsac bulge, and many small transport vesicles are clustered around the \nexpanded edges of the individual sacs. The vesicles concentrated at\nthe periphery of the Golgi apparatus are active in transporting and \ntransferring material between the individual sacs of the Golgi ap\nparatus as well as between the Golgi apparatus and other cellular \nstructures.\n The Golgi apparatus exhibits a distinct polarity: The mem\nbranes of the cisternae at opposite ends of a stack differ in thickness \nand molecular composition. These two poles of the Golgi apparatus \nare called the receiving region (or cis-face) and the shipping \nregion (or trans-face), respectively. The diameter of the flattened \nsac is larger in the receiving region than in the shipping region. The \nproducts of the rough ER move through the Golgi apparatus via \ntransport vesicles, going from the receiving region to the shipping \nregion. Normally, materials move through the Golgi apparatus as \nshown in figure 2.9b and described here:\n 1. Newly synthesized proteins in the rough ER cisternae are \nsequestered into a transport vesicle.\n 2. The vesicle pinches off the rough ER and travels to the Golgi \napparatus.\n 3. Newly arrived transport vesicles fuse with the receiving region \nof the Golgi apparatus.\n 4. Protein modification occurs as the proteins are moved by \ntransport vesicles sequentially through the Golgi apparatus \ncisternae from the receiving region to the shipping region.\n 5. Modified proteins are packaged in secretory vesicles.\n 6. Vesicles leaving the shipping region become (a) lysosomes, \nwhich contain proteins called digestive enzymes, (b) secretory \nvesicles that undergo exocytosis, or (c) new parts of the plasma \nmembrane\n\n Lysosomes Lysosomes (lī′sō-sōm; lysis = a loosening, soma = body) \nare membrane sacs formed by the Golgi apparatus (figure 2.10). \nLysosomes contain enzymes used by the cell to digest waste prod\nucts and ingested macromolecules. These enzymes break down \nlarge molecules, such as proteins, fats, polysaccharides, and nucleic \nacids, into smaller molecules. Lysosomes are sometimes referred \nto as the “garbagemen” of the cell because they digest and remove \nwaste products.\n Some substances digested by lysosomal enzymes enter the cell \nby endocytosis. Lysosomes fuse with endocytic vesicles, and their \nenzymes combine with the internalized materials. The products re\nsulting from these digestive activities are released from the lysosome \ninto the cytosol, where they are recycled for various future uses. For \nexample, a large protein is broken down into its component amino \nacids, which may be used to synthesize a new, different protein \nneeded by that cell.\n Lysosomes also remove the cell’s damaged parts. An in\nternal membrane encloses these damaged structures, and then it \nfuses with the lysosomes. Thus, old organelles are removed via \na process called autophagy (aw-tōf′ă-jē; autos = self, phago =  \nto eat). When a cell is damaged or dies, enzymes from all ly\nsosomes are eventually released into the cell, resulting in the \nrapid digestion of the cell itself. This process is called autolysis \n(aw-tol′i-sis; autos = self, lysis = dissolution). There are specific \ntypes of autophagy named for the organelle or macromolecule that \nis being degraded.\n\n Peroxisomes Peroxisomes (pĕ-rok′si-sōm) are membrane-enclosed  \nsacs that are usually smaller in diameter than lysosomes (fig ure 2.11). \nThey are formed by pinching off vesicles from the rough ER. \nPeroxisomes use oxygen to catalytically detoxify specific harm\nful substances either produced by the cell or taken into the cell. \nFor example, the peroxisome is able to convert hydrogen peroxide \n(a toxic compound) that is sometimes produced by cells into water \nbefore it can damage the cell. It does this using the enzyme catalase, \nwhich is a component of the peroxisome. Peroxisomes are most \nabundant in liver cells, where they break down fatty acids and detox\nify some toxic materials, such as alcohol, that are absorbed in the  \ngastrointestinal tract.\n\nMitochondria Mitochondria (mī′ to-kon′drē-ă; sing., mitochon\ndrion, mī-tō-kon′drē-on′; mitos = thread, chondros = granule) are \norganelles with a double membrane that are involved in producing \nlarge amounts of the cell’s energy currency, ATP. For this reason, \nmitochondria are called the “powerhouses” of the cell. A mito\nchondrion is completely surrounded by an outer membrane, while \na second, or inner membrane, is folded internally into the space at \nthe center of the organelle. These folds, called cristae (kris′ tă, -tē;  \ncrista = crest), increase the surface area that is exposed to the \ninternal fluid contents, termed the matrix (figure 2.12). Inner \nmembrane proteins, including enzymes for ATP synthesis, are on \nthe cristae.\n The number of mitochondria in a cell depends upon the cell’s \nenergy needs. Because mitochondria can self-replicate, the numbers \nof mitochondria are greater in cells that have a high energy demand. \nFor example, muscle cells with a high rate of energy usage have \na large number of mitochondria in their cytoplasm. Mitochondria \nnumbers increase with increased demands for ATP. Additionally, \nmitochondria contain a circular chromosome (chromosomes are \ndescribed in section 2.5c). In the mitochondria, this piece of DNA \ncontains genes for producing mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondrial \nshape also varies among cells. Interestingly, the head of a sperm \ncontains no mitochondria because that portion has no energy need. \nInstead, there are mitochondria in the midpiece of the sperm, the \nregion responsible for propelling the sperm.\n\n Non-Membrane-Bound Organelles\n Organelles that are always in direct contact with the cytosol are \ncalled either non-membrane-bound organelles or nonmembranous \norganelles.\n Ribosomes Ribosomes (rī′bō-sōm; ribos = reference to a 5-carbon \nsugar, soma = body) are very small, dense granules that are responsible \nfor protein production (synthesis). Each ribosome has a small subunit \nand a large subunit (figure 2.13a); the small subunit is about one-half \nthe size of the large subunit. The parts of the subunits are formed in \nthe nucleus, and the subunits are assembled within the cytosol at the \ntime when a new protein is about to be synthesized. Once ribosomes \nare assembled, those that float freely within the cytosol of the cell are \ncalled free ribosomes, whereas those that are attached to the rough \nendoplasmic reticulum are called bound ribosomes (figure 2.13b). \nFree ribosomes are responsible for the synthesis of proteins that remain \nwithin the cytosol of the cell. Bound ribosomes produce proteins that \nare exported outside the cell, incorporated into the plasma membrane, \nor housed as enzymes within a new lysosome.\n\nCytoskeleton The cytoskeleton is composed of protein subunits \norganized either as filaments or hollow tubes. The cytoskeleton has \nthree separate components—microfilaments, intermediate filaments, \nand microtubules—which differ in their structures and functions \n(figure 2.14)\n\n Microfilaments (mī′krō-fil′ă-ment; micros = small) are the \nsmallest components of the cytoskeleton. They are about 7 nano\nmeters (nm) in diameter and are composed of thin protein filaments \n(actin proteins) organized into two intertwined strands. They form \nan interlacing network on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma mem\nbrane. Microfilaments help maintain cell shape, support changes in \ncell shape, participate in muscle contraction, separate the two cells \nformed during cell division, and facilitate cytoplasmic streaming, \nwhich is the movement of the cytoplasm associated with changing \ncell shape.\n\n Intermediate filaments are between 8 nm and 12 nm in di\nameter, and are more rigid than microfilaments. They support cells \nstructurally and stabilize junctions between cells. Their protein \ncomponent differs, depending upon the cells in which they occur in \nthe body.\n\n\n Microtubules (mī′krō-tū′byūl; micros = small, tubus = tube) \nare hollow tubules, about 25 nm in diameter, composed of long \nchains of a protein called tubulin. Microtubules radiate from the \ncentrosome (discussed next) and help hold organelles in place, \nmaintain cell shape and rigidity, direct organelle movement be\ntween different regions of the cell, provide a means of cell motility \nusing structures called cilia or flagella, and move chromosomes \nduring the process of cell division. Microtubules are not permanent \nstructures, and they can be elongated or shortened as needed to \ncomplete their functions\n\nCentrosome and Centrioles Closely adjacent to the nucleus in \nmost cells is a nonmembranous, spherical structure called the centrosome. \nThe matrix of this region is a microtubule organization center\nthat supports the growth and elongation of microtubules. Within the \nregion of the centrosome are a pair of cylindrical centrioles (sen′trē-ōl;  \nkentron = a point, center) that lie perpendicular to one another. Each \ncentriole is composed of nine sets of three closely aligned micro\ntubules, called microtubule triplets, that are arranged in a circle \n(figure 2.15). The centrioles replicate immediately prior to cell \ndivision (mitosis). During mitosis (described in section 2.6b), they \nare responsible for organizing microtubules that are a part of the \nmitotic spindle. Some of these microtubules attach to chromosomes \nto facilitate their movement.\n\nCilia and Flagella Cilia (sil′ē-ă; sing., cilium, sil′ē-ŭm; an eyelash) \nand flagella (flă-jel′ă; sing., flagellum, flă-jel′ŭm; a whip) are projec\ntions extending from the cell. They are composed of cytoplasm and \nsupportive microtubules enclosed by the plasma membrane.\nCilia are found in large numbers on some cell surfaces ex\nposed to the external environment (figure 2.16a). For example, cells \nwith cilia line parts of the respiratory passageways. Here, these cili\nated cells are always associated with mucin-secreting goblet cells. \nMucus that is formed from the secreted mucin appears as a sticky \nfilm on the free surface of ciliated cells. The beating of the cilia\nmoves the mucus and any adherent particulate material along the \ncell surface toward the throat, where it may then be expelled from \nthe body.\n Flagella are similar to cilia in basic structure; however, they \nare longer and usually appear alone (figure 2.16c). The function of a \nflagellum is to help propel or move an entire cell. In humans, the only \nexample of a cell with a flagellum is the sperm.\n\n Microvilli Microvilli are thin, microscopic projections extending \nfrom the surface of the plasma membrane. They are much smaller \nthan cilia, much more densely packed together, and do not have \npowered movement (see figure 2.3). The main function of microvilli \nis to increase the surface area of the plasma membrane. In essence, \nthese projections create a more extensive plasma membrane surface \nfor molecules to travel across. Just as not all cells have cilia, not all \ncells have microvilli. Cells with microvilli occur throughout the \nsmall intestine, where increased surface area is needed to absorb \ndigested nutrients\n",

         "10 Muscle Tissue and Organization\n10.2 Characteristics of Skeletal Muscle Tissue\n10.2c Microscopic Anatomy of Skeletal Muscle\n----------\n\nSkeletal muscle fibers have many of the same components as the \ntypical cells described in sections 2.2 through 2.5 but some of these \ncomponents are named differently (table 10.2)\n For instance, the plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber \nis called the sarcolemma (sar′kō-lem′ă; sarx = flesh, lemma =  \nhusk), and the cytoplasm of the muscle fiber is called the \nsarcoplasm (sar′kō-plazm) (figure 10.3). A typical muscle fiber \ncontains abundant mitochondria (about 300 mitochondria per \nmuscle fiber), because the fibers have a great demand for energy. \nThey also contain lysosomes and other cellular organelles. Two \nmain structures are unique to muscle fibers: T-tubules and sarco\nplasmic reticulum.\n Transverse (trans-vers′; trans = across, versus = to turn) \ntubules, or T-tubules, are deep invaginations of the sarcolemma \nthat extend into the sarcoplasm of muscle fibers as a network of nar\nrow membranous tubules. Muscle impulses generated when a nerve \nimpulse reaches the sarcolemma travel rapidly along the sarcolemma \nand then spread internally along the membranes of the T-tubule \nnetwork. The passage of this impulse helps stimulate and coordinate \nmuscle contractions, as described in section 10.3c.\n Muscle fibers contain another internal membrane com\nplex called the sarcoplasmic (sar′kō-plaz′mik) reticulum  \n(re-tik′yū-lŭm; rete = a net) (SR) that is similar to the smooth \nendoplasmic reticulum of other cells. The sarcoplasmic reticulum \nstores calcium ions needed to initiate muscle contraction. Some \nparts of the sarcoplasmic reticulum run parallel to the muscle \nfiber, whereas other parts appear as blind sacs perpendicular to \nthe fiber’s length. These blind sacs of the sarcoplasmic reticulum \nare called terminal cisternae (sis-ter′nē; sing., sis-ter′nă). Pairs \nof terminal cisternae are immediately adjacent to each T-tubule; \nthey are the reservoirs and specific sites for calcium ion release \nto initiate muscle contraction, and they interact with the T-tubules \nduring muscle contraction. Together, the two terminal cisternae \nand the centrally placed T-tubule form a structure called a triad \n(figure 10.3b).\n Recall from section 4.4a that skeletal muscle fibers are multi- \nnucleated. This increase in the number of nuclei occurs during \ndevelopment when groups of embryonic cells, termed myoblasts \n(mī ′ō-blast; blastos = germ), fuse to form single muscle fibers \n(figure 10.4). During this fusion process, each myoblast nucleus \ncontributes to the eventual total number of nuclei. Some myo\nblasts do not fuse with muscle fibers during development. These \ncells remain in adult skeletal muscle tissue as satellite (sat′ĕ-līt) \ncells. If a skeletal muscle is injured, some satellite cells may be \nstimulated to differentiate and fuse with the damaged muscle \nfiber and assist, to a limited extent, in its repair and regeneration.\n Myofibrils and Myofilaments\n About 80% of the volume of a muscle fiber is composed \nof long, cylindrical structures termed myofibrils (mı ̄′ō-fı ̄′bril) \n(figure 10.3a). A muscle fiber contains hundreds to thousands \nof myofibrils. Each myofibril is about 1 to 2 micrometers in di\nameter and extends the length of the entire muscle fiber. During \ncontraction, the myofibrils shorten as their component proteins \nchange position. Because myofibrils are attached to the ends of \nthe muscle fiber, the shortening of the myofibrils during a contrac\ntion causes the fiber to shorten. Myofibrils consist of bundles of \nshort myofilaments (mī′ō-fil′ă-ments; filum = thread). Whereas a \nsingle myofibril runs the length of the muscle fiber, it takes many \n successive groupings of myofilaments to run the entire length of \na myofibril.\n Thick and Thin Filaments The bundles of myofilaments are clas\nsified as thick myofilaments (usually called thick filaments) and thin \nmyofilaments (usually simply called thin filaments) (figure 10.5).\n Thick filaments have a diameter of about 11 nanometers and \nare assembled from bundles of 200 to 500 myosin protein molecules. \nEach myosin molecule in a thick filament consists of two strands; each \nstrand has a free, globular head and an attached, elongated tail. The \ntails of the two strands are intertwined. The myosin molecules are \noriented so that their long tails extend toward the center of the thick \nfilament and their heads extend toward the edges of the thick filament \nand project outward toward the surrounding thin filaments. During a \ncontraction, myosin heads form crossbridges by binding thick fila\nments to actin in the thin filaments.\n In contrast, thin filaments are only about 5 to 6 nanometers in \ndiameter (about half the diameter of thick filaments). They are pri\nmarily composed of two strands of the protein actin twisted around \neach other to form a helical shape. In each helical strand of actin, \nmany (300 to 400) small, spherical molecules are connected to form \na long filament resembling a string of beads. Each spherical molecule \nis called G (globular) actin, and each filament composed of a strand \nof G-actin molecules is called F (filamentous) actin. Two regulatory \nproteins, tropomyosin (trō′pō-mī ′ō-sin) and troponin (trō ′pō-nin), \nare part of the thin filaments. The tropomyosin molecule is a short, \nthin, twisted filament that covers small sections of the actin strands. \nThe troponin attaches to actin and tropomyosin. It also provides a \nbinding site for calcium ions.\n Organization of a Sarcomere\n Myofilaments within myofibrils are arranged in repeating micro\nscopic cylindrical units (2 micrometers in length) called sarcomeres \n(sar′kō-mēr; meros = part). A sarcomere is the functional contractile \nunit of a skeletal muscle fiber. Figure 10.6a shows several repeating \nsarcomeres in a section of a myofibril within a muscle fiber. The num\nber of sarcomeres will vary with the length of the myofibril within \nthe muscle fiber. Each sarcomere is composed of overlapping thick \nfilaments and thin filaments. An individual sarcomere is shown in \nfigure 10.6b–d, and its components are listed in table 10.3. Here we \nsee that each sarcomere is delineated at both ends by Z discs. Z discs \n(also called Z lines) are composed of specialized proteins that are \npositioned perpendicular to the myofilaments and serve as anchors for \nthe thin filaments. Although the Z disc appears as a flat disc when the \nmyofibril is viewed in cross section, only the edge of the disc is visible \nin a side view, and it sometimes looks like a zigzagged line.\n\nThe thick filaments and thin filaments overlap within a sarco\nmere, forming the following regions: \n■ I bands extend from both directions of a Z disc and are \nbisected by the Z disc. These end regions contain only \nthin filaments; this region appears light when viewed with \na microscope. At maximal muscle shortening, the thin \nfilaments are pulled parallel along the thick filaments, \ncausing the I band to disappear. \n■ The A band is the central region of a sarcomere that contains \nthe entire thick filament. Thin filaments partially overlap the\nthick filament on each end of an A band. The A band appears \ndark when viewed with a microscope. The A band does not \nchange in length during muscle contraction. \n■ The H zone (also called the H band) is the most central portion \nof the A band in a resting sarcomere. This region does not have \nthin filament overlap; only thick filaments are present. During \nmaximal muscle shortening, this zone disappears when the thin \nfilaments are pulled past thick filaments. \n■ The M line is a thin transverse protein meshwork structure in \nthe center of the H zone. It serves as an attachment site for the \nthick filaments and keeps the thick filaments aligned during \ncontraction and relaxation events. \nThe overlapping myofilaments form unique patterns of alternating \nlight and dark regions within a skeletal muscle fiber. When a longi\ntudinal section of skeletal muscle tissue is viewed in a microscope, it \nappears striated (striped) (see table 10.6). This striated appearance is \ndue to both the size and density differences between thin filaments \nand thick filaments. \nFigure 10.5b shows cross sections through various regions in a \nsarcomere. It presents the relative sizes, arrangements, and organization \nof thick and thin filaments at different locations within the sarcomere. \nNotice that in a cross section of an A band the arrangement of thick \nfilaments relative to thin filaments is the following: Each thin filament \nhas three thick filaments around it that form a triangle at its periphery, \nand each thick filament is sandwiched by six thin filaments.\nOther Structural and Functional Proteins There are other pro\nteins that have structural and functional roles within muscle fibers. \nThese include connectin, nebulin, and dystrophin. \nConnectin (kon-nek′tin), also called titin, is a “cablelike” \nprotein that extends from the Z discs to the M line through the core \nof each thick filament (see figure 10.6b, c). It stabilizes the posi\ntion of the thick filament and maintains thick filament alignment \nwithin a sarcomere. Additionally, portions of the connectin mol\necules are coiled and “springlike,” so that during contraction they \nare compressed to produce passive tension. This passive tension is \nreleased to return the sarcomere to its resting length. Thus, connectin \ncontributes to muscle fiber elasticity. \nNebulin (neb ́yū-lin) appears to be an actin-binding protein that \nis part of the I band of the sarcomere (figure 10.5b). Studies indicate \nthat the length of nebulin is proportional to the length of the thin \nfilament and helps determine thin filament length during sarcomere \nassembly. \nDystrophin (dis-trō′fin) is part of a protein complex that an\nchors myofibrils that are adjacent to the sarcolemma to proteins within \nthe sarcolemma. These proteins of the sarcolemma also extend to the \nconnective tissue of the endomysium that encloses the muscle fiber. \nThus, dystrophin links internal myofilament proteins of a muscle \nfiber to external proteins. The genetic disorder of muscular dystrophy \nis caused by abnormal structure, or amounts, of dystrophin protein \n(see Clinical View 10.6: “Neuromuscular Diseases” in section 10.11).\n\n### Table 10.2 Muscle Fiber Components\n| **Structure** | **Description** | **Function** |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Muscle Fiber** | Single skeletal muscle cell | Metabolic activities; contraction |\n| **Sarcolemma** | Plasma membrane of a muscle fiber | Surrounds muscle fiber and regulates entry and exit of materials |\n| **Sarcoplasm** | Cytoplasm of a muscle fiber | Site of metabolic processes for normal muscle fiber activities |\n| **Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR)** | Smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a muscle fiber | Stores calcium ions needed for muscle contraction |\n| **Terminal Cisternae** | Expanded ends of the SR in contact with transverse tubules | Site of calcium ion release to promote muscle contraction |\n| **Transverse Tubule (T-tubule)** | Narrow tubes of sarcolemma that extend into sarcoplasm and wrap around myofibrils | Quickly transports a muscle impulse from sarcolemma throughout muscle fiber |\n| **Myofibrils** | Organized bundles of myofilaments; cylindrical structures as long as the muscle fiber | Contain myofilaments responsible for muscle contraction |\n| **Thick Filament** | Myofilament composed of bundles of myosin (≈11 nm) | Binds to thin filament and causes contraction |\n| **Thin Filament** | Myofilament composed of actin, troponin, and tropomyosin (≈5–6 nm) | Thick filaments bind to it and cause contraction |\n| **Actin** | Double-stranded contractile protein | Binding site for myosin to shorten a sarcomere |\n| **Tropomyosin** | Double-stranded regulatory protein | Covers actin active sites to prevent myosin binding when muscle is at rest |\n| **Troponin** | Regulatory protein anchored to actin and attached to tropomyosin | Binds calcium, causing tropomyosin to move and expose actin binding sites |\n| **Connectin (Titin)** | Single giant molecular filament | Organizes sarcomere structure and provides passive tension |\n| **Nebulin** | Giant protein filament | Possibly regulates thin filament length |\n| **Dystrophin** | Protein complex | Anchors myofibrils to the sarcolemma proteins |\n\n\n### Table 10.3 Sarcomere and Its Components\n| **Structure** | **Description** | **Does It Shorten/Narrow During Contraction?** |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Sarcomere** | Functional contractile unit of skeletal muscle; the distance between two adjacent Z discs | **Yes** |\n| **A band** | Dark band in the middle of the sarcomere; composed of entire thick filaments and, at its lateral regions, overlapping thin filaments | **No** |\n| **H zone** | Lighter region in the middle of the A band; contains thick filaments only | **Yes** |\n| **M line** | Thin transverse protein meshwork in the center of the H zone where thick filaments attach | **No** |\n| **I band** | Light band containing thin filaments only and connectin proteins | **Yes** |\n| **Z disc** | Dark proteins called connectins in the center of the I band where thin filaments attach | **No** |\n",

         "9 Articulations\n9.5 Selected Articulations in Depth\n9.5c Joints of the Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limbs\n----------\n\nTable 9.5 lists the features of the major joints of the pelvic girdle and \nlower limbs. Here, we provide an in-depth examination of several of \nthese joints.\n Hip (Coxal) Joint\n The hip joint, also called the coxal joint, is the articulation between \nthe head of the femur and the relatively deep, concave acetabulum of \nthe os coxae (figure 9.18). A fibrocartilaginous acetabular labrum \nfurther deepens this socket. The hip joint’s more extensive bony \narchitecture is therefore much stronger and more stable than that of \nthe glenohumeral joint. Conversely, the hip joint’s increased stabil\nity means that it is less mobile than the glenohumeral joint. The hip \njoint must be more stable (and thus less mobile) because it supports \nthe body weight.\n The hip joint is secured by a strong articular capsule, several \nligaments, and a number of powerful muscles. The articular capsule \nextends from the acetabulum to the trochanters of the femur, enclosing \nboth the femoral head and neck. This arrangement prevents the head \nfrom moving away from the acetabulum. The ligamentous fibers \nof the articular capsule reflect around the neck of the femur. These \nreflected fibers, called retinacular (ret-i-nak′yū-lăr; retinacula =  \na band) fibers, provide additional stability to the capsule. Traveling \nthrough the retinacular fibers are retinacular arteries (branches of the \ndeep femoral artery), which supply almost all of the blood to the head \nand neck of the femur.\n The articular capsule is reinforced by three spiraling \nintracapsular ligaments. The iliofemoral (il′ē-ō-fem′ŏ-răl) ligament \nis a Y-shaped ligament that provides strong reinforcement for the  \nanterior region of the articular capsule. The ischiofemoral \n(is-kē-ō-fem′ŏ-răl) ligament is a spiral-shaped, posteriorly located lig\nament. The pubofemoral (pyū′bō-fem′ŏ-răl) ligament is a triangular \nthickening of the capsule’s inferior region. All of these spiraling liga\nments become taut when the femur is extended at the hip joint, so the \nhip joint is most stable in the extended position. Try this experiment: \nFlex your hip joint, and try to move the femur; you may notice a great \ndeal of mobility. Now extend your hip joint (stand up), and try to move \nthe femur. Because those ligaments are taut, you don’t have as much \nmobility in the joint as you did when the hip joint was flexed.\n Another tiny ligament, the ligament of head of femur, also \ncalled the ligamentum teres, originates along the acetabulum. Its at\ntachment point is the center of the head of the femur. This ligament \ndoes not provide much strength to the joint; rather, it typically con\ntains a small artery that supplies the head of the femur.\n The combination of a deep bony socket, a strong articular \ncapsule, supporting ligaments, and muscular padding gives the hip \njoint its stability. Movements possible at the hip joint include flex\nion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation, and circumduction \nof the femur.\n Knee Joint\n The knee joint is the largest and most complex diarthrosis of the \nbody (figure 9.19). It primarily functions as a hinge joint, but when \nthe knee is flexed, it is also capable of slight rotation and lateral \n gliding. Structurally, the knee is composed of two separate articula\ntions: (1) the tibiofemoral (tib′ē-ō-fem′ŏ-răl) joint is between the \ncondyles of the femur and the condyles of the tibia, and (2) the \n patellofemoral joint is between the patella and the patellar surface of  \nthe femur.\nThe knee joint has an articular capsule that encloses only the \nmedial, lateral, and posterior regions of the knee joint. The articular \ncapsule does not cover the anterior surface of the knee joint; rather, \nthe quadriceps femoris muscle tendon passes over the anterior sur\nface. The patella is embedded within this tendon, and the patellar \nligament extends beyond the patella and continues to its attachment \non the tibial tuberosity of the tibia. Thus, there is no single unified \ncapsule in the knee, nor is there a common joint cavity. Posteriorly, \nthe capsule is strengthened by several popliteal ligaments.\n On either side of the joint are two collateral ligaments that \nbecome taut on extension and provide additional stability to the joint. \nThe fibular collateral ligament (lateral collateral ligament) rein\n273\n forces the lateral surface of the joint. This ligament runs from the \nfemur to the fibula and prevents hyperadduction of the leg at the knee. \n(In other words, it prevents the leg from moving too far medially rela\ntive to the thigh.) The tibial collateral ligament (medial collateral \nligament) reinforces the medial surface of the knee joint. This \nligament runs from the femur to the tibia and prevents hyperabduction \nof the leg at the knee. (In other words, it prevents the leg from moving \ntoo far laterally relative to the thigh.) This ligament is attached to the \nmedial meniscus of the knee joint as well, so an injury to the tibial \ncollateral ligament usually affects the medial meniscus.\n Deep to the articular capsule and within the knee joint itself \nare a pair of C-shaped fibrocartilage pads located on the condyles \n of the tibia. These pads, called the medial meniscus and the lateral \nmeniscus, partially stabilize the joint medially and laterally, act as \ncushions between articular surfaces, and  continuously change shape \nto conform to the articulating surfaces as the femur moves. \nAlso deep to the articular capsule of the knee joint are two \ncruciate (krū′shē-āt) ligaments, which limit the anterior and pos\nterior movement of the femur on the tibia. These ligaments cross \neach other in the form of an X, hence the name “cruciate” (which \n means “cross”). The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) runs from \nthe posterior femur to the anterior side of the tibia. When the knee is \nextended, the ACL is pulled tight and prevents hyperextension of the \nleg at the knee joint. The ACL prevents the tibia from moving too far \nanteriorly on the femur. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) runs \nfrom the anteroinferior femur to the posterior side of the tibia. The \nPCL becomes taut on flexion, and so it prevents hyperflexion of the \nleg at the knee joint. The PCL also prevents posterior displacement \nof the tibia on the femur.\n “Locking” the Knee Humans are bipedal animals, meaning that they \nwalk on two feet. An important aspect of bipedal locomotion is the abil\nity to “lock” the knees in the extended position and stand erect for long \nperiods without tiring the leg muscles. At full extension, the tibia rotates \nlaterally so as to tighten the anterior cruciate ligament and squeeze the \nmeniscus between the tibia and femur. Muscular contraction by the \npopliteus muscle (see section 12.2c) unlocks the knee joint. Contraction \nof this muscle causes a slight rotational movement between the tibia and \nthe femur. \n Talocrural (Ankle) Joint The talocrural joint, or ankle joint, is a \nhighly modified hinge joint that permits dorsiflexion and plantar flexion \nof the foot at the ankle, and includes two articulations within one articu\nlar capsule. One of these articulations is between the distal end of the \ntibia and the talus, and the other is between the distal end of the fibula \nand the lateral aspect of the talus (figure 9.20). The medial and lateral \nmalleoli of the tibia and fibula, respectively, form extensive medial and \nlateral margins and prevent the talus from sliding side-to-side.\n The talocrural joint includes several distinctive anatomic features. \nAn articular capsule covers the distal surfaces of the tibia, the medial \nmalleolus, the lateral malleolus, and the talus. A multipart deltoid \nligament (or medial ligament) binds the tibia to the foot on the me\ndial side. This ligament prevents overeversion of the foot. The deltoid  \nligament is incredibly strong and rarely tears; in fact, it will pull the \nmedial malleolus off the tibia before it ever ruptures! A much thinner, \nmultipart lateral ligament binds the fibula to the foot on the lateral side. \nThis ligament prevents overinversion of the foot. It is not as strong as the \ndeltoid ligament, and is prone to sprains and tears (see Clinical View 9.8: \n“Ankle Sprains” in this section). Two  tibiofibular (tib′ē-ō-fib′yū-lăr) \nligaments (anterior and posterior) bind the tibia to the fibula. \nJoints of the Foot\n Four types of synovial joints occur in the foot: intertarsal joints, tar\nsometatarsal joints, metatarsophalangeal joints, and interphalangeal \njoints (figure 9.21). Intertarsal joints are the articulations between \nthe tarsal bones. Some of these joints go by specific names (e.g., \ntalonavicular joint, calcaneocuboid joint). It is at the intertarsal joints \nthat inversion and eversion of the foot occur (see figure 9.11). \nThe articulations between the tarsal and metatarsal bones form \nthe tarsometatarsal (tar′sō-met′ă-tar′săl) joints. These are plane \narticulations that permit some twisting and limited side-to-side move\nments of the tarsal bones. The medial, intermediate, and lateral cu\nneiform bones articulate with the first three metatarsals. The fourth \nand fifth metatarsals articulate with the cuboid.\n The metatarsophalangeal (met′ă-tar′sō-fă-lan′jē-ăl) joints, also \ncalled the MP joints, are between the metatarsals and the phalanges of \nthe toes. These are condylar joints, and they permit limited abduction \nand adduction of the toes, as well as flexion and extension of the toes.\n Finally, the interphalangeal (IP) joints occur between in\ndividual phalanges. Each interphalangeal joint is a hinge joint that \npermits flexion and extension only. \n\nWHAT DID YOU LEARN?\n ●12 Which ligaments support the hip joint?\n ●13 List the intracapsular ligaments of the knee joint, and discuss \ntheir functions.\n ●14 Compare the deltoid and lateral ligaments of the ankle joint. \nWhich of these ligaments is stronger?

In this section, \nwe describe the characteristics of these types of epithelium and show \nhow each appears using light microscopy.\n Simple Squamous Epithelium\n A simple squamous epithelium consists of a single layer of flattened \ncells (table 4.2a). When viewed en face, the irregularly shaped cells \ndisplay a spherical to oval nucleus, and they appear tightly bound \ntogether. Each squamous cell resembles a fried egg, with the nucleus \nrepresenting the yolk. This epithelium is extremely delicate and \nhighly specialized to allow rapid movement of molecules and ions \nacross its surface by membrane transport processes (see section 2.3c). \nSimple squamous epithelium is found only in protected regions where \nmoist surfaces reduce friction and abrasion. For example, in the lin\ning of the lung air sacs (alveoli), the thin epithelium is well suited \nfor the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood \nand inhaled air. This type of epithelium is also found lining the \nlumen (inside space) of blood vessel walls, where it allows for rapid \nexchange of nutrients and waste between the blood and the interstitial \nfluid surrounding the blood vessels.\n Simple squamous epithelia that line closed internal body \ncavities and all circulatory structures have special names. The simple \nsquamous epithelium that lines the lumen of the blood and lymphatic \nA simple cuboidal epithelium consists of a single layer of cells that \nare as tall as they are wide (table 4.2b). A spherical nucleus is located \nin the center of the cell. A simple cuboidal epithelium functions \nprimarily for absorption and secretion. It forms the walls of kidney \ntubules, where it participates in the reabsorption of nutrients, ions, \nand water that are filtered out of the blood plasma. It also forms the \nducts of exocrine glands, which secrete materials. Simple cuboidal \nepithelium covers the surface of the ovary and also lines the follicles \nof the thyroid gland.\n Simple Columnar Epithelium\n A simple columnar epithelium is composed of a single layer of tall, \nnarrow cells. The nucleus is oval, oriented lengthwise, and located \nwithin the basal region of the cell. Active movement of molecules oc\ncurs across this type of epithelium by either absorption or secretion. \nSimple columnar epithelium has two forms; one type has no cilia, \nwhereas the apical surface of the other type is lined by cilia.\n Nonciliated simple columnar epithelium often contains  \nmicrovilli and a scattering of unicellular glands called goblet cells \n(table 4.2c). Recall that microvilli are tiny, cytoplasmic projections on \nthe apical surface of the cell that increase the surface area for secre\ntion and absorption (see table 2.2). You cannot distinguish individual \nmicrovilli with light microscopy; rather, the microvilli collectively \nappear as a more darkly stained, fuzzy structure known as a brush \nborder. Goblet cells secrete mucin (myū′sin; mucus = mucus), a \nglycoprotein that when hydrated (mixed with water) forms mucus. \nNonciliated simple columnar epithelium lines most of the digestive \ntract, from the stomach to the anal canal.\n Ciliated simple columnar epithelium has cilia that project from \nthe apical surfaces of the cells (table 4.2d). Mucus covers these apical \nsurfaces and is moved along by the beating of the cilia. Goblet cells \ntypically are interspersed throughout this epithelium. This type of \nepithelium lines the luminal (internal) surface of the uterine tubes, \nwhere its cilia help move an oocyte from the ovary to the uterus. A \nciliated simple columnar epithelium is also present in the bronchioles \n(smaller air tubes) of the lung.\n Pseudostratified Columnar Epithelium\n Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is so named because upon \nfirst glance, it appears to consist of multiple layers of cells. How\never, this epithelium is not really stratified, because all of its cells \nare in direct contact with the basement membrane. Although it may \nlook stratified because the nuclei are scattered at different distances \nfrom the basal surface, not all of the cells reach the apical surface \n(table 4.2e). The columnar cells within this epithelium always reach \nthe apical surface; the shorter cells are stem cells that give rise to the \ncolumnar cells.\n There are two forms of pseudostratified columnar epithe\nlium: Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium has cilia \non its apical surface, whereas pseudostratified nonciliated \ncolumnar epithelium lacks cilia. Both types of this epithelium \nperform protective functions. The ciliated form houses goblet \ncells, which secrete mucin that forms mucus. This mucus traps \nforeign particles and is moved along the apical surface by the \nbeating of the cilia.\n Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium lines much of \nthe larger portions of the respiratory tract, including the nasal cavity, \npart of the pharynx (throat), the larynx (voice box), the trachea, and \nthe bronchi. The cilia in this epithelium help propel dust particles and \nforeign materials away from the lungs and to the nose and mouth. In \ncontrast, the nonciliated form of this epithelium has no goblet cells. It \nis a rare epithelium that occurs primarily in part of the male urethra \nand the epididymis.\n Stratified Squamous Epithelium\n A stratified squamous epithelium has multiple cell layers, and \nonly the deepest layer of cells is in direct contact with the basement \nmembrane. The cells in the basal layers appear cuboidal or polyhe\ndral, whereas the apical cells display a flattened, squamous shape. \nThus, stratified squamous epithelium is so named because of its \nmultiple cell layers and the shape of its apical cells. This epithelium \nis adapted to protect underlying tissues from damage due to activi\nties that are abrasive and cause friction. Stem cells in the basal layer \ncontinuously divide to produce a new stem cell and a committed cell \nthat gradually moves toward the surface to replace the cells lost dur\ning protective activities. This type of epithelium exists in two forms: \nkeratinized and nonkeratinized.\n\n\n### Table 4.2 Simple Epithelia \n\n| Feature   | (a) Simple Squamous Epithelium | (b) Simple Cuboidal Epithelium | (c) Nonciliated Simple Columnar Epithelium | (d) Ciliated Simple Columnar Epithelium | (e) Pseudostratified Columnar Epithelium |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Structure | Single layer of thin, flat, irregularly shaped cells resembling floor tiles; the single nucleus of each cell bulges at its center | Single layer of cells about as tall as they are wide; spherical, centrally located nucleus | Single layer of tall, narrow cells; oval-shaped nucleus oriented lengthwise in the basal region of the cell; apical regions of cells have microvilli; may contain goblet cells that secrete mucin | Single layer of tall, narrow, ciliated cells; oval-shaped nucleus oriented lengthwise in the basal region of the cell; goblet cells may be present | Single layer of cells with varying heights that appears multilayered; all cells connect to the basement membrane, but not all cells reach the apical surface.

Nonciliated form is rare; lines epididymis and part of male urethra |\n\n\n In keratinized (ker′ă-ti-nīzd; keras = horn) stratified \nsquamous epithelium, the apical surface is composed of layers \nof cells that are dead; these cells lack nuclei and all organelles \nand are filled with keratin, a tough, protective, fibrous protein. \nIt is obvious that the superficial cells lack nuclei when they  \nare viewed with light microscopy (table 4.3a). New commit\nted cells produced in the basal region of the epithelium migrate \ntoward the apical surface. During their migration, they fill with\nkeratin, lose their organelles and nuclei, and die. However, the \nkeratin in these dead cells makes them very strong. Thus, there \nis a tradeoff with the appearance of keratin, in that the tissue be\ncomes very strong, but the cells must die as a result. The epidermis \n(outer layer) of the skin consists of keratinized stratified squamous \nepithelium.\n The cells in nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium \nremain alive all the way to its apical surface, and they are kept \n lines the vagina, the oral cavity (mouth), part of the pharynx (throat), \nthe esophagus, and the anus.\n Stratified Cuboidal Epithelium\n A stratified cuboidal epithelium contains two or more layers of \ncells, and the apical cells tend to be cuboidal in shape (table 4.3c). \nThis type of epithelium forms the walls of the larger ducts of most \nexocrine glands, such as the sweat glands in the skin. Although the \nfunction of stratified cuboidal epithelium is mainly protective, it also \nserves to strengthen the wall of gland ducts.\n Stratified Columnar Epithelium\n A stratified columnar epithelium is relatively rare in the body. It \nconsists of two or more layers of cells, but only the apical surface \ncells are columnar in shape (table 4.3d). This type of epithelium is \nfound in the membranous segment of the male urethra and in the \nlarge ducts of the salivary glands.\n Transitional Epithelium\n A transitional epithelium varies in appearance, depending upon \nwhether it is in a relaxed or a stretched state (table 4.3e). In a relaxed \nstate, the basal cells appear almost cuboidal, and the  apical cells are \nlarge and rounded. During stretching, the transitional epithelium \nthins, and the apical cells continue to flatten, becoming almost \nsquamous. In this distended state, it may be difficult to distinguish \na transitional epithelium from a squamous epithelium. However, one \ndistinguishing feature of transitional epithelium is the presence of a \nhandful of binucleated (containing two nuclei) cells. This epithelium \nlines the urinary bladder, an organ that changes shape as it fills with \nurine. It also lines the ureters and the proximal part of the urethra. \nTransitional epithelium permits stretching and ensures that toxic \nurine does not seep into the underlying tissues and structures of these \norgans. \n\n\n### Table 4.3 Stratified epithelia\n| Feature   | (a) Keratinized Stratified Squamous Epithelium | (b) Nonkeratinized Stratified Squamous Epithelium | (c) Stratified Cuboidal Epithelium | (d) Stratified Columnar Epithelium | (e) Transitional Epithelium |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Structure | Multiple layers of cells; basal cells typically are cuboidal or polyhedral, whereas apical (superficial) cells are squamous; more superficial cells are dead and filled with the protein keratin | Multiple layers of cells; basal cells typically are cuboidal or polyhedral, whereas apical (superficial) cells are squamous; surface cells are alive and kept moist | Two or more layers of cells; cells at the apical surface are cuboidal | Two or more layers of cells; cells at the apical surface are columnar | Epithelial appearance varies, depending on whether the tissue is stretched or relaxed; shape of cells at apical surface changes; some cells may be binucleated |\n| Function  | Protection of underlying tissue | Protection of underlying tissue | Protection and secretion | Protection and secretion | Distension and relaxation to accommodate urine volume changes in bladder, ureters, and urethra |\n| Location  | Epidermis of skin | Lining of vagina, oral cavity, part of pharynx, esophagus, and anus | Found in large ducts in most exocrine glands and in some parts of the male urethra | Rare; found in some regions of the male urethra and in large ducts of some exocrine glands | Lining of urinary bladder, ureters, and part of urethra |\n",

One example of a long bone is the \nfemur (thigh bone) (figure 6.4). A typical long bone contains the  \nfollowing parts:\n ■ One of the principal gross features of a long bone is its shaft, \nwhich is called the diaphysis (dī-af′i-sis; pl., diaphyses,  \ndī-af′i-sēz; growing between). The elongated, usually \ncylindrical diaphysis provides for the leverage and major \nweight support of a long bone.\n ■ At each end of a long bone is an expanded, knobby region \ncalled the epiphysis (e-pif′i-sis; pl., epiphyses, e-pif′i-sēz; \nepi = upon, physis = growth). The epiphysis is enlarged \nto strengthen the joint and provide added surface area for \nbone-to-bone articulation as well as tendon and ligament \nattachment. It is composed of an outer layer of compact bone \nand an inner layer of spongy bone. A proximal epiphysis is \nthe end of the bone closest to the body trunk, and a distal \nepiphysis is the end farthest from the trunk.\n ■ The metaphysis (mĕ-taf′i-sis) is the region of a long bone \nwhere the bone widens and transfers forces between the \ndiaphysis and the epiphysis. In a growing bone, this region \ncontains the epiphyseal (growth) plate, thin layers of  \nhyaline cartilage that provide for the continued lengthwise \ngrowth of the diaphysis. In adults, the remnant of the \nepiphyseal plate is a thin layer of compact bone called the \nepiphyseal line.\n ■ The thin layer of hyaline cartilage covering the epiphysis at \na joint surface is called articular cartilage. This cartilage \nhelps reduce friction and absorb shock in movable joints.\n ■ The hollow, cylindrical space within the diaphysis is called \nthe medullary cavity (marrow cavity). In adults, it contains \nyellow bone marrow.\n ■ The endosteum (en-dos′tē-ŭm; endo = within, osteon = bone) \nis an incomplete layer of cells that covers all internal surfaces of \nthe bone, such as the medullary cavity. The endosteum contains \nosteoprogenitor cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts (figure 6.5), \nand is active during bone growth, repair, and remodeling.\n ■ A tough sheath called periosteum (per′ē-os′tē-ŭm; peri = \naround) covers the outer surface of the bone, except for the \nareas covered by articular cartilage. Periosteum is formed \nby dense irregular connective tissue and consists of an outer \n fibrous layer and an inner cellular layer (figure 6.5). The \nperiosteum is anchored to the bone by numerous strong \ncollagen fibers called perforating fibers (also known as \nSharpey fibers), which run perpendicular to the diaphysis. The \nperiosteum protects the bone from surrounding structures, \nanchors blood vessels and nerves to the surface of the bone, \nand provides stem cells (osteoprogenitor cells and osteoblasts) \nfor bone growth in width and fracture repair.\n\nCells of Bone\n Four types of cells occur in bone connective tissue: osteoprogenitor \ncells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts (figure 6.6).\n Osteoprogenitor (os′tē-ō-prō-jen′i-tŏr; osteo = bone) cells \nare stem cells derived from mesenchyme. When they divide, they \nproduce another stem cell and a “committed cell” that matures to \n become an osteoblast. These stem cells are located in both the peri\nosteum and the endosteum.\n Osteoblasts are formed from osteoprogenitor stem cells. Often, \nosteoblasts exhibit a somewhat cuboidal structure. They secrete the \ninitial semisolid, organic form of bone matrix called osteoid (os′tē\noyd; eidos = resemblance). Osteoid later calcifies and hardens as a \nresult of calcium salt deposition. Osteoblasts produce new bone, and \nonce osteoblasts become entrapped in the matrix they produce and \nsecrete, they differentiate into osteocytes.\n Osteocytes are mature bone cells derived from osteoblasts that \nhave become entrapped in the matrix they secreted. They reside in \nsmall spaces within the matrix called lacunae. Osteocytes maintain \nthe bone matrix and detect mechanical stress on a bone. This infor\nmation is communicated to osteoblasts, and may result in the deposi\ntion of new bone matrix at the surface.\n Osteoclasts (os′tē-ō-klast′; klastos = broken) are large, \nmultinuclear, phagocytic cells. They are derived from fused bone \nmarrow cells similar to those that produce monocytes (described \nin section 21.3b). These cells exhibit a ruffled border where they \ncontact the bone, which increases their surface area exposure to the \nbone. An osteoclast is often located within or adjacent to a depres\nsion or pit on the bone surface called a resorption lacuna (Howship \nlacuna). Osteoclasts are involved in an important process called \nbone resorption that takes place as follows: Osteoclasts secrete \nhydrochloric acid, which dissolves the mineral parts (calcium and \nphosphate) of the bone matrix, while lysosomes within the osteo\nclasts secrete enzymes that dissolve the organic part of the matrix.  \nThe release of the stored calcium and phosphate from the bone \nmatrix is called osteolysis (os′tē-ol′i-sis; lysis = dissolution, loos\nening). The liberated calcium and phosphate ions enter the tissue \nfluid and then the blood. \nOsteoblasts add to bone matrix and osteoclasts remove the ma\ntrix, thus maintaining a delicate balance. Osteoblast and osteoclast \nactivity are affected by hormonal levels (discussed in section 6.5a), \nthe body’s need for calcium and/or phosphorus, and gravitational or \nmechanical stressors to bone. For example, when a person wears orth\nodontic braces, osteoblasts and osteoclasts work together to modify \nthe tooth-jaw junction, in response to the mechanical stress applied \nby the braces to the teeth and jaw. If osteoclasts resorb the bone to \nremove calcium salts at a faster rate than osteoblasts produce matrix \nto stimulate deposition, bones lose mass and become weaker; in \ncontrast, when osteoblast activity outpaces osteoclast activity, bones \nhave a greater mass.\n Composition of the Bone Matrix\n The matrix of bone connective tissue has both organic and inorganic \ncomponents. About one-third of bone mass is composed of organic \ncomponents called osteoid. It includes cells, collagen fibers, and \nground substance. (The ground substance is the semisolid material \nthat suspends and supports the collagen fibers.) The collagen fibers \ngive a bone tensile strength by resisting stretching and twisting, \nand contribute to its overall flexibility. The inorganic components \nof the bone provide its compressional strength. Calcium phosphate, \nCa3(PO4)2, accounts for most of the inorganic components of bone. \nCalcium phosphate and calcium hydroxide interact to form crystals \nof hydroxyapatite (hī-drok′sē-ap-ă-tīt), which is Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. \nThese crystals deposit around the collagen fibers, leading to harden\ning of the extracellular matrix. The crystals also incorporate other \nsalts, such as calcium carbonate, and ions, such as sodium, magne\nsium, sulfate, and fluoride, in the process of calcification.\n Comparison of Compact and Spongy Bone\n Two types of bone connective tissue are present in most of the bones \nof the body: compact bone (also called dense or cortical bone) and \nspongy bone (also called cancellous or trabecular bone). As their \nnames imply, compact bone is solid and relatively dense, whereas \nspongy bone appears more porous, like a sponge. The arrangement \nof compact bone and spongy bone components differs at the micro\nscopic level. In a long bone, compact bone forms the solid external \nwalls of the bone, and spongy bone is located internally, primarily \nwithin the epiphyses. Spongy bone forms an open lattice of narrow \nplates of bone, called trabeculae (tră-bek′yū-lē; sing., trabecula, \ntră-bek′yū -lă; trabs = a beam). In a flat bone of the skull, the spongy \nbone, also called diploë (dip′lō-ē; diplous = double), is sandwiched \nbetween two layers of compact bone (figure 6.7).\n Compact Bone Microscopic Anatomy Compact bone has an \norganized structure when viewed with light microscopy. A cylin\ndrical osteon (os′tē-on), or Haversian system, is the basic func\ntional and structural unit of mature compact bone. Osteons run \nparallel to the diaphysis of the long bone. When viewed in cross \n section, an osteon has the appearance of a bull’s-eye target. An \nosteon is a three-dimensional structure that has several components  \n(figures 6.8 and 6.9a).\n ■ The central canal (Haversian canal) is a cylindrical channel \nthat lies in the center of the osteon. Traveling within the \ncentral canal are the blood vessels and nerves that supply  \nthe bone.\n ■ Concentric lamellae (lă-mel′-ē; sing., lamella, lă-mel′ă; \nlamina = plate, leaf) are rings of bone connective tissue \nthat surround the central canal and form the bulk of the \nosteon. The numbers of concentric lamellae vary among \nosteons. Each lamella contains collagen fibers oriented in one \ndirection; adjacent lamellae contain collagen fibers oriented \nin perpendicular directions. In other words, if one lamella has \ncollagen fibers directed superiorly and to the right, the next \nlamella will have collagen fibers directed superiorly and to the \nleft. This alternating collagen fiber direction gives bone part of \nits strength and resilience.\n ■ Osteocytes are housed in lacunae and occur between adjacent \nconcentric lamellae.\n ■ Canaliculi (kan′ă-lik′yū-lī; sing., canaliculus, kan′ă\nlik′yū-lŭs; canalis = canal) are tiny channels through bone \nconnective tissue that connect lacunae and the central \ncanal. Canaliculi house osteocyte cytoplasmic projections \nthat permit intercellular contact and communication. Thus, \nnutrients, minerals, gases, and wastes can travel through these \npassageways between the central canal and the osteocytes. \nSeveral other structures occur in compact bone, but are not part \nof the osteon proper, including the following (see figure 6.8):\n ■ Perforating canals (Volkmann canals) resemble central \ncanals in that they also contain blood vessels and nerves. \nHowever, perforating canals run perpendicular to the  \ncentral canals and help connect multiple central canals, thus \ncreating a vascular and innervation connection among the \nmultiple osteons.\n ■ Circumferential lamellae are rings of bone immediately \ninternal to the periosteum of the bone (external \ncircumferential lamellae) or internal to the endosteum \n(internal circumferential lamellae). These two distinct \nregions appear during the original formation of the  \nbone. Both external and internal circumferential lamellae  \nrun the entire circumference of the bone itself (hence,  \ntheir name).\n ■ Interstitial lamellae are the leftover parts of osteons that have \nbeen partially resorbed. They often look like a “bite” has been \ntaken out of them. The interstitial lamellae are incomplete and \ntypically have no central canal. \n\nSpongy Bone Microscopic Anatomy Spongy bone contains \nno osteons (figure 6.9b). Instead, the trabeculae of spongy bone are \ncomposed of parallel lamellae (see figure 6.8c). Between adjacent \nlamellae are osteocytes resting in lacunae, with numerous canaliculi \nradiating from the lacunae. Nutrients reach the osteocytes by diffu\nsion through canaliculi that open onto the surfaces of the trabeculae. \nNote that the trabeculae often form a meshwork of crisscrossing bars \nand plates of bone pieces. This structure provides great resistance \nto stresses applied in many directions by distributing the stress \nthroughout the entire framework. As an analogy, visualize the jungle \ngym climbing apparatus on a children’s playground. It is capable \nof supporting the weight of numerous children whether they are \ndistributed throughout its structure or all localized in one area. This \nis accomplished because stresses and forces are distributed through\nout the structure.",

         "9 Articulations\n9.5 Selected Articulations in Depth\n9.5b Joints of the Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limbs\n----------\n\nTable 9.4 lists the features of the major joints of the pectoral girdle \nand upper limbs. Here, we provide an in-depth examination of several \nof these joints.\n Sternoclavicular Joint\n The sternoclavicular (ster′nō-kla-vik′yū-lăr) joint is a saddle joint \nformed by the articulation between the manubrium of the sternum \nand the sternal end of the clavicle (figure 9.14). An articular disc \npartitions the sternoclavicular joint into two parts and creates two \nseparate joint cavities. As a result, a wide range of movements of the \nclavicle at this joint is possible, including elevation, depression, and \ncircumduction.\n Support and stability are provided to this articulation by \nthe fibers of the articular capsule. The anterior sternoclavicular \nligament and the posterior sternoclavicular ligament reinforce \nthe capsule. In addition, two extracapsular ligaments also help \nstrengthen the joint: (1) The clavicle is attached to the first rib by \nthe strong, wide costoclavicular ligament. This ligament stabilizes \nthe joint and prevents dislocation of the shoulder when the shoulder \nis elevated. (2) The interclavicular ligament runs along the sternal \nnotch and attaches to each clavicle. It reinforces the superior regions \nof the adjacent capsules. This design makes the sternoclavicular joint \nvery stable. If a person falls on an outstretched hand so that force is \napplied to the joint, the clavicle will fracture before this joint ever \ndislocates.\n Acromioclavicular Joint\n The acromioclavicular (ă-krō′mē-ō-kla-vik′yū-lăr) joint is a plane \njoint between the acromion and the acromial end of the clavicle \n(figure 9.15). A fibrocartilaginous articular disc lies within the joint \ncavity between these two bones. This joint works with both the ster\nnoclavicular joint and the glenohumeral joint to give the upper limb \na full range of movement.\n Several ligaments provide great stability to this joint. The articular \ncapsule is strengthened superiorly by an acromioclavicular ligament. \nIn addition, a very strong coracoclavicular (kōr′ă-kō-kla-vik′yū-lăr) \nligament binds the clavicle to the coracoid process of the scapula. \nThe coracoclavicular ligament is responsible for most of the stabil\nity of the joint, because it indirectly prevents the clavicle from los\ning contact with the acromion. If this ligament is torn (as occurs in \nsevere shoulder separations; see Clinical View 9.4: “Shoulder Joint \nDislocations” in this section), the acromion and clavicle no longer \nalign properly.\n Glenohumeral (Shoulder) Joint\n The glenohumeral (glē′nō-hyū′mer-ăl) joint is commonly referred \nto as the shoulder joint. It is a ball-and-socket joint formed by the \narticulation of the head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity of the \nscapula (figure 9.15). It permits the greatest range of motion of any \njoint in the body, and so it is also the most unstable joint in the body \nand the one most frequently dislocated.\n The fibrocartilaginous glenoid labrum encircles and cov\ners the surface of the glenoid cavity. A relatively loose articular \ncapsule attaches to the surgical neck of the humerus. The gleno\nhumeral joint has several major ligaments. The coracoacromial \n(kōr′ă-kō-ă-krō′mē-ăl) ligament extends across the space between \nthe coracoid process and the acromion. The large coracohumeral \n(kōr′ă-kō-hyū′mer-ăl) ligament is a thickening of the superior \npart of the joint capsule. It runs from the coracoid process to the \nhumeral head. The glenohumeral ligaments are three thickenings \nof the anterior portion of the articular capsule. These ligaments \nare often indistinct or absent and provide only minimal support. \nIn addition, the tendon of the long head of biceps brachii travels \nwithin the articular capsule and helps stabilize the humeral head \nin the joint.\n Unlike other joints of the body (where ligaments provide most \nof the support), the ligaments of the glenohumeral joint do little \nto strengthen the joint. Instead, most of the glenohumeral joint’s \nstrength is due to the rotator cuff muscles surrounding it (see sec\ntion 12.1b). The rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, \nteres minor, and subscapularis) work as a group to hold the head \nof the humerus in the glenoid cavity. The tendons of these muscles \nencircle the joint (except for the inferior portion) and fuse with the \narticular capsule. Because the inferior portion of the joint lacks \nrotator cuff muscles, this area is weak and is the most likely site \nof injury.\nBursae help decrease friction at the specific places on the \nshoulder where both tendons and large muscles extend across the ar\nticular capsule. The shoulder has a relatively large number of bursae, \nseveral of which are shown in figure 9.15. \nElbow Joint\n The elbow joint is a hinge joint composed primarily of two articula\ntions: (1) the humeroulnar joint, where the trochlear notch of the ulna \narticulates with the trochlea of the humerus; and (2) the humeroradial \njoint, where the capitulum of the humerus articulates with the head of \nthe radius. These joints are enclosed within a single articular capsule \n(figure 9.16).\n The elbow is an extremely stable joint for several reasons. \nFirst, the articular capsule is fairly thick, and thus effectively \nprotects the articulations. Second, the bony surfaces of the humerus \nand ulna interlock very well, and thus provide a solid bony support.\n Finally, multiple strong supporting ligaments help reinforce the artic\nular capsule. Remember that there is a tradeoff between stability and \nmobility in a joint. Thus, although the elbow joint is very stable, it is \nnot as mobile as some other joints, such as the glenohumeral joint.\n The elbow joint has two main supporting ligaments. The radial \ncollateral ligament (or lateral collateral ligament) is responsible for \nstabilizing the joint at its lateral surface; it extends around the head \nof the radius between the anular ligament and the lateral epicondyle \nof the humerus. The ulnar collateral ligament (or medial collateral \nligament) stabilizes the medial side of the joint and extends from the \nmedial epicondyle of the humerus to both the coronoid process of the \nulna, and posteriorly to the olecranon. This ligament may be torn by \nrepetitive use of the joint (e.g., as seen with some pitchers). The torn \nligament can be replaced with another tendon to restore elbow func\ntion, in a procedure known as Tommy John surgery. \nIn addition, the elbow joint has an anular (an′yū-lăr; anulus \n= ring) ligament that surrounds the neck of the radius and binds  \nthe proximal head of the radius to the ulna. The anular ligament helps \nhold the head of the radius in place, allowing for rotation of the radial \nhead against the ulna for pronation and supination of the forearm.\n Despite the support from the capsule and ligaments, the \nelbow joint is subject to damage from a severe impact or unusual \nstress. For example, if you fall on an outstretched hand with your \nelbow joint partially flexed, the posterior stress on the ulna com\nbined with contractions of muscles that extend the elbow may break \nthe ulna at the center of the trochlear notch. Sometimes disloca\ntions result from stresses to the elbow. This is particularly true \nwhen growth is still occurring at the epiphyseal plate, so children \nand teenagers may be prone to humeral epicondyle dislocations or \nfractures. \n\nRadiocarpal (Wrist) Joint\n The radiocarpal (rā′dē-ō-kar′păl) joint, also known as the wrist \njoint, is an articulation among the three proximal carpal bones \n(scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum), the distal articular surface of the \nradius, and a fibrocartilaginous articular disc (figure 9.17). This \narticular disc separates the ulna from the radiocarpal joint (which \nis why the ulna is not considered part of this joint). The entire wrist \ncomplex is ensheathed by an articular capsule that has reinforcing \nbroad ligaments to support and stabilize the carpal bone positions. \nThe radiocarpal joint is a condylar articulation that permits flexion, \nextension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction, but no rota\ntion. Rotational movements (in the form of supination and prona\ntion) occur at the distal and proximal radioulnar joints. \nAdditional movements in the wrist are made possible by \nintercarpal articulations, which are plane joints that permit gliding \nmovements between the individual carpal bones.\n\n\n### Table 9.4 Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb Joints\n| **Joint** | **Articulation Components** | **Structural Classification** | **Functional Classification / Description of Movements** |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sternoclavicular | Manubrium of sternum and sternal end of clavicle | Synovial (saddle) | Diarthrosis; depression, elevation, circumduction of clavicle |\n| Acromioclavicular | Acromial end of clavicle and acromion of scapula | Synovial (plane) | Diarthrosis; gliding of scapula on clavicle |\n| Glenohumeral | Glenoid cavity of scapula and head of humerus | Synovial (ball-and-socket) | Diarthrosis; flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, lateral rotation, medial rotation of arm |\n| Elbow | Humeroulnar joint: trochlea of humerus and trochlear notch of ulna<br>Humeroradial joint: capitulum of humerus and head of radius | Synovial (hinge) | Diarthrosis; flexion and extension of forearm |\n| Radioulnar | Proximal joint: head of radius and radial notch of ulna<br>Distal joint: distal end of ulna and ulnar notch of radius | Synovial (pivot) | Diarthrosis; rotation of radius with respect to ulna |\n| Radiocarpal | Distal end of radius; lunate, scaphoid, and triquetrum | Synovial (condylar) | Diarthrosis; flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction of wrist |\n| Intercarpal | Adjacent bones in proximal row of carpals; adjacent bones in distal row; adjacent bones between proximal and distal rows (midcarpal joints) | Synovial (plane) | Diarthrosis; gliding of the carpals |\n| Carpometacarpal | Thumb: trapezium and first metacarpal<br>Other digits: carpals and metacarpals II–V | Synovial (saddle) at thumb; synovial (plane) at other digits | Diarthrosis; thumb—flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, opposition; other digits—gliding |\n| Metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints / “knuckles” | Heads of metacarpals and bases of proximal phalanges | Synovial (condylar) | Diarthrosis; flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction of phalanges |\n| Interphalangeal (IP) joints | Heads of proximal and middle phalanges with bases of middle and distal phalanges, respectively | Synovial (hinge) | Diarthrosis; flexion and extension of phalanges |\n",

         "7 Axial Skeleton\n7.1 Skull\n7.1a Views of the Skull and Landmark Features\n----------\n\n The skull is composed of multiple bones that exhibit complex \nshapes, and each bone articulates with at least one other. To best \nunderstand the complex nature of the skull, we first examine the \nskull as a whole and learn which bones are seen optimally from a \nparticular view. Note that only some major features will be men\ntioned in this section. Later in this section we examine the individual \nskull bones in detail.\n A cursory glance at the skull reveals numerous bone mark\nings, such as canals, fissures, and foramina, which are passageways \nfor blood vessels and nerves. The major foramina and canals of the \ncranial and facial bones are listed in table 7.1. Refer to this table as \nwe examine the skull from various directions. (This table also will \nbe important when we study individual nerves and blood vessels in \nsections 15.8 and 23.3, respectively.)\n Anterior View\n An anterior view best shows several major bones of the skull  \n(figure 7.4). The frontal bone forms the forehead. Put your hand \non your forehead; you are feeling your frontal bone. The left and \nright orbits (eye sockets) are formed from a complex articulation of  \nmultiple skull bones. Within the orbits are two large openings, called \nthe superior orbital fissure and the inferior orbital fissure. Superior \nto the orbits are the superciliary arches, otherwise known as the brow \nridges. The left and right nasal bones form the bony “bridge” of the \nnose. Superior to the nasal bones and between the orbits is a landmark \narea called the glabella.\n The left and right maxillae join to form most of the upper \njaw and the lateral boundaries of the nasal cavity. The maxillae also \nhelp form the floor of each orbit. Inferior to each orbit, within each \nmaxilla, is an infraorbital foramen, which conducts blood vessels \nand nerves to the face. The lower jaw is formed by the mandible. The \nprominent “chin” of the mandible is called the mental protuberance.\n An anterior view also shows the nasal cavity. Its inferior border \nis marked by a prominent anterior nasal spine. The thin ridge of bone \nthat subdivides the nasal cavity into left and right halves helps form \nthe nasal septum. Along the lateral walls of the nasal cavity are two \nscroll-shaped bones called the inferior nasal conchae.\n Superior View\n The superior view of the skull in figure 7.5a primarily shows four of \nthe cranial bones: the frontal bone, both parietal bones, and the oc\ncipital bone. The articulation between the frontal and parietal bones \nis the coronal suture, so named because it runs along a coronal plane. \nThe sagittal suture connects the left and right parietal bones almost \nexactly in the midline of the skull.\n Along the posterior one-third of the sagittal suture are either a sin\ngle parietal foramen or paired parietal foramina. These foramina conduct \ntiny emissary veins from the veins of the brain to the veins of the scalp. \nThe number of parietal foramina can vary in individuals and between left \nand right sides of the same skull. The superior part of the lambdoid suture \nrepresents the articulation of the occipital bone with both parietal bones.\n Posterior View\n The posterior view of the skull in figure 7.5b shows part of the oc\ncipital bone and its lambdoid suture, as well as portions of the parietal \nand temporal bones. The external occipital protuberance is a bump \non the back of the head. Palpate the back of your head; the size and \nshape of this protuberance varies from large and angular to subtle \nand rounded (based upon genetic and hormonal sex.) Within the \nlambdoid suture there may be one or more sutural (Wormian) bones.\n Lateral View\n The lateral view of the skull in figure 7.6 shows the following skull \nbones: one parietal bone, one temporal bone, one zygomatic bone, \none  maxilla, the frontal bone, the mandible, and portions of the \noccipital bone. The tiny lacrimal bone articulates with the nasal \nbone anteriorly and with the ethmoid bone posteriorly. A portion of \nthe sphenoid bone articulates with the frontal, parietal, and tempo\nral bones. The region called the pterion (tē′rē-on; ptéron = wing), \ncircled on figure 7.6, represents the H-shaped set of sutures of these \nfour articulating bones.\n The temporal process of the zygomatic bone and the zygomatic \nprocess of the temporal bone fuse to form the zygomatic arch. Put \nyour fingers along the bony prominences (“apples”) of your cheeks \nand move your fingers posteriorly to your ears; you are feeling the \nzygomatic arch. The zygomatic arch terminates superior to the point \nwhere the mandible articulates with the mandibular fossa of the tem\nporal bone. This articulation is called the temporomandibular joint.  \nBy putting your finger anterior to your external ear opening and open\ning your jaw, you can feel that joint moving. The external ear opening \noverlies the external acoustic meatus of the skull. Posterior to this canal \nis the mastoid process, the bump you feel posterior to your ear lobe.\n Sagittal Sectional View\n Cutting the skull along a sagittal sectional plane reveals bones that form the \nnasal cavity and the endocranium (figure 7.7). The cranial cavity is formed \nfrom a complex articulation of the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, \nethmoid, and sphenoid bones. Vessel impressions on the internal surface \nof the skull show up clearly. The frontal sinus (a space in the frontal bone) \nand the sphenoidal sinus (a space in the sphenoid bone) are visible.\n A sagittal sectional view also shows the bones that form the \nnasal septum more clearly. The perpendicular plate forms the supe\nrior portion of the nasal septum, whereas the vomer forms the inferior \nportion. The ethmoid bone serves as a wall between the anterior floor \nof the cranial cavity and the roof of the nasal cavity. The maxillae and \npalatine bones form the hard palate, which acts as both the floor of  \nthe nasal cavity and part of the roof of the mouth. Move your tongue \nalong the roof of your mouth; you are palpating the maxillae anteri\norly and the palatine bones posteriorly.\n\n Inferior (Basal) View\n In an inferior (basal) view, the skull looks a bit complex, with all of \nits foramina and weird-shaped bone features (figure 7.8). However, \nyou will soon be able to recognize and distinguish some features that \nmay be used as landmarks.\n The most anterior structure is the hard palate. On the posterior \naspect of either side of the palate are the pterygoid processes of the \nsphenoid bone. Adjacent to these structures are the internal openings \nof the nasal cavity, called the choanae.\n Between the mandibular fossa and the pterygoid processes are \nseveral foramina (fō-ram′i-nă; sing., foramen, fō′rā′men; forare = to \nbore) and canals. Closest to the pterygoid process is the foramen ovale, \nand lateral to this opening is the foramen spinosum. Posterior and \nlateral to these foramina is the jugular (jŭg′yū-lăr; jugulum = throat)\nforamen, which is a space between the temporal and occipital bones. \nThe entrance to the carotid canal is anteromedial to the jugular fora\nmen. The foramen lacerum (anteromedial to the carotid canal) extends \nbetween the occipital and temporal bones. This opening is covered by \ncartilage in a living individual.\n The largest foramen of all is the foramen magnum, literally \nmeaning big hole. Through this opening, the spinal cord enters the \ncranial cavity and becomes continuous with the brainstem. On either \nside of the foramen magnum are the rounded occipital condyles, \nwhich articulate with the vertebral column.\n\nInternal View of Cranial Base\n When the superior part of the skull is cut and removed, the internal \nview of the cranial base (figure 7.9) reveals the frontal bone sur\nrounding the delicate cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. Posterior \nto the frontal bone are the lesser wings and the greater wings of the \nsphenoid bone. The temporal bones form the lateral regions of the \ncranial base, and the occipital bone forms its posterior aspect.\n Many of the foramina labeled on the inferior view of the skull \ncan also be seen from this internal view, but some new openings are \nvisible as well. For example, left and right optic canals are located \nin the lesser wings of the sphenoid. The internal acoustic meatus is \nlocated more posteriorly in the temporal bone.\n\n\n\n### Table 7.1  Passageways Within the Skull\n| **Passageway** | **Location** | **Primary Structures That Pass Through** |\n|----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| **Cranial Bones** | | |\n| Carotid canal | Petrous part of temporal bone | Internal carotid artery |\n| Cribriform foramina | Cribriform plate of ethmoid bone | Olfactory nerves (CN I) |\n| Foramen lacerum | Between petrous part of temporal bone, sphenoid bone, and occipital bone | None (covered with cartilage) |\n| Foramen magnum | Occipital bone | Vertebral arteries; spinal cord; accessory nerves (CN XI) |\n| Foramen ovale | Greater wing of sphenoid bone | Mandibular branch of trigeminal nerve (CN V3) |\n| Foramen rotundum | Greater wing of sphenoid bone | Maxillary branch of trigeminal nerve (CN V2) |\n| Foramen spinosum | Greater wing of sphenoid bone | Middle meningeal vessels |\n| Hypoglossal canal | Anteromedial to occipital condyle of occipital bone | Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) |\n| Inferior orbital fissure | Junction of maxilla, sphenoid, and zygomatic bones | Infraorbital nerve (branch of CN V2) |\n| Jugular foramen | Between temporal bone and occipital bone (posterior to carotid canal) | Internal jugular vein; glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX); vagus nerve (CN X); accessory nerve (CN XI) |\n| Mastoid foramen | Posterior to mastoid process of temporal bone | Mastoid emissary veins |\n| Optic canal | Posteromedial part of orbit in lesser wing of sphenoid bone | Optic nerve (CN II) |\n| Parietal foramina | Parietal bone near sagittal suture | Parietal emissary veins |\n| Stylomastoid foramen | Between mastoid and styloid processes of temporal bone | Facial nerve (CN VII) |\n| Superior orbital fissure | Posterior part of orbit between greater and lesser wings of sphenoid bone | Ophthalmic veins; oculomotor nerve (CN III); trochlear nerve (CN IV); ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve (CN V1); abducens nerve (CN VI) |\n| Supraorbital foramen | Supraorbital margin of orbit in frontal bone | Supraorbital artery; supraorbital nerve (branch of CN V1) |\n| **Facial Bones** | | |\n| Greater and lesser palatine foramina | Palatine bone | Palatine vessels; greater and lesser palatine nerves (branches of CN V2) |\n| Incisive foramen | Posterior to incisor teeth in hard palate of maxilla | Nasopalatine nerve (branch of CN V2) |\n| Infraorbital foramen | Inferior to orbit in maxilla | Infraorbital artery; infraorbital nerve (branch of CN V2) |\n| Lacrimal groove | Lacrimal bone | Nasolacrimal duct |\n| Mandibular foramen | Medial surface of ramus of mandible | Inferior alveolar blood vessels; inferior alveolar nerve (branch of CN V3) |\n| Mental foramen | Inferior to second premolar on anterolateral surface of mandible | Mental blood vessels; mental nerve (branch of CN V3) |\n",

         "9 Articulations\n9.4 Synovial Joints\n9.4c Movements at Synovial Joints\n----------\n\nFour types of motion occur at synovial joints: gliding, angular, ro\ntational, and special movements (motions that occur only at specific \njoints) (table 9.2). The specific movements are described in detail on \nthe following pages.\nGliding Motion\n Gliding is a simple movement in which two opposing surfaces slide \nslightly back-and-forth or side-to-side with respect to one another. In \na gliding motion, the angle between the bones does not change, and \nonly limited movement is possible in any direction. Gliding motion \ntypically occurs along plane joints.\n Angular Motion\n Angular motion either increases or decreases the angle between \ntwo bones. These movements may occur at many of the synovial \njoints; they include the following specific types: flexion and exten\nsion, hyperextension, lateral flexion, abduction and adduction, and \ncircumduction.\n Flexion (flek′shŭn; flecto = to bend) is movement in an \nanterior-posterior (AP) plane of the body that decreases the angle \nbetween the articulating bones. Bones are brought closer together \nas the angle between them decreases. Examples include bending \nyour fingers toward your palm to make a fist, bending your forearm \ntoward your arm at the elbow, flexion at the shoulder when you raise \nan arm anteriorly, and flexion of the neck when you bend your head \nanteriorly to look down at your feet. \nThe opposite of flexion is extension (eks-ten′shŭn; extensio = \na stretching out), which is movement in an anterior-posterior plane \nthat increases the angle between the articulating bones. Extension is \na straightening action that usually occurs in the sagittal plane of the \nbody. Straightening your arm and forearm until the upper limb projects \ndirectly away from the anterior side of your body or straightening your \nfingers after making a clenched fist are examples of extension. Flexion \nand extension of various body parts are illustrated in figure 9.7a–d.\n Hyperextension (hī′pĕr-eks-ten′shŭn; hyper = above normal) \nis the extension of a joint beyond its normal range of motion. It may \noccur if someone has extensively mobile joints or has an injury at  \na joint.\n Lateral flexion occurs when the trunk of the body moves in a \ncoronal plane laterally away from the body. This type of movement \noccurs primarily between the vertebrae in the cervical and lumbar \nregions of the vertebral column (figure 9.7e).\n Abduction (ab-dŭk′shŭn), which means to “move away,” is a \nlateral movement of a body part away from the body midline. Ab\nduction occurs when either the arm or the thigh is moved laterally  \naway from the body midline. Abduction of either the fingers or the \ntoes means that you spread them apart, away from the  longest digit, \nwhich is acting as the midline. Abducting the wrist (also known \nas radial deviation) involves pointing the hand and fingers later\nally, away from the body. The opposite of abduction is adduction \n(ă-dŭk′shŭn), which means to “move toward,” and is the medial \nmovement of a body part toward the body midline. Adduction occurs \nwhen you bring your raised arm or thigh back toward the body \nmidline, or in the case of the digits, toward the midline of the hand. \nAdducting the wrist (also known as ulnar deviation) involves point\ning the hand and fingers medially, toward the body. Abduction and \nadduction of various body parts are shown in figure 9.8.\n Circumduction (ser′kŭm-dŭk′shŭn; circum = around, duco = \nto draw) is a sequence of movements in which the proximal end of \nan appendage remains relatively stationary, while the distal end \nmakes a circular motion (figure 9.9). The resulting movement makes \nan imaginary cone shape. For example, when you draw a circle on \nthe blackboard, your shoulder remains stationary while your hand \nmoves. The tip of the imaginary cone is the stationary shoulder, \nwhile the rounded “base” of the cone is the circle the hand makes. \nCircumduction is a complex movement that occurs as a result of a \ncontinuous sequence of flexion, abduction, extension, and adduction.\n\n Rotational Motion\n Rotation is a pivoting motion in which a bone turns on its own \nlongitudinal axis (figure 9.10). Rotational movement occurs at the \natlantoaxial joint, which pivots when you rotate your head to gesture \n“no.” Some limb rotations are described as either away from the \nmedian plane or toward it. For example, lateral rotation (or external \nrotation) turns the anterior surface of the femur or humerus laterally, \nwhereas medial rotation (or internal rotation) turns the anterior \nsurface of the femur or humerus medially.\nPronation (prō-nā′shŭn) is the medial rotation of the forearm \nso that the palm of the hand is directed posteriorly or inferiorly. \nThe radius and ulna are crossed to form an X (see section 8.2b and \nfigure 8.5e). Supination (sū′pi-nā′shŭn; supinus = supine) occurs \nwhen the forearm rotates laterally so that the palm faces anteriorly or \nsuperiorly, and the radius is parallel with the ulna (see figure 8.5d). \nIn the anatomic position, the forearm is supinated. Figure 9.10d \nillustrates pronation and supination.\n\nSpecial Movements\nSome motions occur only at specific joints and do not readily fit into \nany of the functional categories previously discussed. These special \nmovements include depression and elevation, dorsiflexion and plan\ntar flexion, inversion and eversion, protraction and retraction, and \nopposition.\n Depression (de = away or down, presso = to press) is the \ninferior movement of a part of the body. Examples of depression \ninclude opening your mouth (by depressing the mandible) to chew \nfood and the movement of your shoulders in an inferior direction. \nElevation is the superior movement of a body part. Examples of \nelevation include the superior movement of the mandible while \n closing your mouth at the temporomandibular joint and the move\nment of the shoulders in a superior direction (shrugging your \nshoulders). Figure 9.11a illustrates depression and elevation at the \nglenohumeral joint.\n Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are limited to the ankle joint \n(figure 9.11b). Dorsiflexion (dōr′si-flek′shŭn) occurs when the talo\ncrural (ankle) joint is bent such that the superior surface of the foot \nand toes moves toward the leg. This movement occurs when you dig \nin your heels, and it prevents your toes from scraping the ground \nwhen you take a step. In plantar (plan′tar; planta = sole of foot) \nflexion, movement at the talocrural joint permits extension of the \nfoot so that the toes point inferiorly. When a ballerina is standing \non her tiptoes (en pointe), her ankle joint is in full plantar flexion.\n Inversion and eversion are movements that occur at the inter\ntarsal joints of the foot only (figure 9.11c). In inversion (in-ver′zhŭn; \nturning inward), the sole of the foot turns medially. In eversion \n(ē-ver′zhŭn; turning outward), the sole turns to face laterally. (Note: \nSome orthopedists and runners use the terms pronation and supina\ntion when describing foot movements as well, instead of using inver\nsion and eversion. Simply put, inversion is foot supination, whereas \neversion is foot pronation.)\n Protraction (prō-trak′shŭn; to draw forth) is the anterior \nmovement of a body part from anatomic position, as when moving \nyour jaw anteriorly at the temporomandibular joint or hunching \nyour shoulders anteriorly by crossing your arms (see figure 12.3a). \nIn the latter case, the clavicles move anteriorly due to move\nment at both the acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints.  \nRetraction (rē-trak′shŭn; to draw back) is the posteriorly directed \nmovement of a body part from anatomic position. Figure 9.11d il\nlustrates protraction and retraction at the temporomandibular joint.\nAt the carpometacarpal joint, the thumb moves toward the \npalmar tips of the fingers as it crosses the palm of the hand. This \nmovement is called opposition (op′ō-si′shŭn) (figure 9.11e). It enables \nthe hand to grasp objects and is the most distinctive digital movement \nin humans. The opposite movement is called reposition.\n\n\n### Table 9.2 Movements at Synovial Joints\n| **Movement** | **Description** | **Opposing Movement** |\n|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| **Gliding Motion** | Two opposing articular surfaces slide past each other in almost any direction; movement is slight | — |\n| **Angular Motion** | The angle between articulating bones increases or decreases | — |\n| Flexion | Angle between articulating bones decreases | Extension |\n| Extension | Angle between articulating bones increases | Flexion |\n| Lateral Flexion | Vertebral column bends laterally along a coronal plane | None |\n| Abduction | Lateral movement of a body part away from the midline | Adduction |\n| Adduction | Medial movement of a body part toward the midline | Abduction |\n| Circumduction | Continuous movement combining flexion, abduction, extension, and adduction; distal end moves in a circle | None |\n| **Rotational Motion** | Bone pivots around its own longitudinal axis | — |\n| Pronation | Rotation of the forearm with palm turned posteriorly | Supination |\n| Supination | Rotation of the forearm with palm turned anteriorly | Pronation |\n| **Special Movements** | Movements not fitting other categories | — |\n| Depression | Movement of a body part inferiorly | Elevation |\n| Elevation | Movement of a body part superiorly | Depression |\n| Dorsiflexion | Ankle joint movement bringing dorsum of foot closer to anterior leg surface | Plantar flexion |\n| Plantar Flexion | Ankle joint movement bringing sole of foot toward posterior leg surface | Dorsiflexion |\n| Inversion | Twisting motion turning sole medially/inward | Eversion |\n| Eversion | Twisting motion turning sole laterally/outward | Inversion |\n| Protraction | Anterior movement of a body part from anatomic position | Retraction |\n| Retraction | Posterior movement of a body part from anatomic position | Protraction |\n| Opposition | Thumb movement across palm toward fingers for grasping | Reposition |\n",

         "5 Integumentary System\n5.5 Integumentary Structures Derived from Epidermis\n5.5c Exocrine Glands of the Skin\n----------\n\nThe skin houses two types of exocrine glands: sweat (sudoriferous) \nglands and sebaceous glands (figure 5.10a) (see section 4.1f). Sweat \nglands produce a watery solution that performs several specific \nfunctions. Sebaceous glands produce an oily material that coats hair \nshafts and the epidermal surface. Table 5.3 compares the types of \nglands found in the skin.\n\nFigure 5.10\n Exocrine Glands of the Skin. (a) The integument contains sweat glands and sebaceous glands. (b) Merocrine sweat glands have a duct with a narrow lumen that \nopens onto the skin surface through a pore. (c) Apocrine sweat glands exhibit a duct with a large lumen to convey secretion products into a hair follicle. (d) The \ncells of sebaceous glands are destroyed during the release of their oily secretion into the follicle. \n\n\n\n Sweat (Sudoriferous) Glands\n The two types of sweat glands in the skin are merocrine sweat \nglands and apocrine sweat glands. These sweat glands have a \ncoiled, tubular secretory portion located either in the reticular layer \nof the dermis, or in the subcutaneous layer. A sweat gland duct \ntransports the secretion to the surface of the epidermis (in a mero\ncrine gland) or into a hair follicle (in an apocrine gland). The open\ning of the sweat gland duct on the epidermal surface is an indented \nregion called a sweat pore.\n Both types of sweat glands contain myoepithelial cells. These \nspecialized cells are sandwiched between the secretory gland cells \nand the underlying basement membrane. In response to sympathetic \nnervous system stimulation (see section 18.2), myoepithelial cells \ncontract to squeeze the gland, causing it to discharge its accumulated \nsecretions into the duct.\n WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n ● 4 The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system  \nis the part of the nervous system that can be activated when \nwe are frightened or nervous. What would you expect to \nhappen to sweat gland production and secretion when we  \nare experiencing these emotions?\n Merocrine Sweat Glands Merocrine sweat glands are simple, \ncoiled, tubular glands that release their secretion onto the surface \nof the skin by exocytosis (see section 2.3c). They are the most \nnumerous and widely distributed sweat glands in the body. The \nadult integument contains between 3 and 4 million merocrine \nsweat glands. The palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, and the \nforehead have the highest numbers of these glands; some estimates \nsuggest that the palm of each hand houses about 500 merocrine \nglands per square centimeter (or about 3000 glands per square \ninch). Merocrine sweat glands are controlled by the nervous system. \nThe secretory portion of the gland is housed within the dermis or \nthe subcutaneous layer; the conducting portion of the gland is an \nundulating or coiled duct leading to a sweat pore on the skin surface \n(figure 5.10b).\n The clear secretion produced by merocrine glands is termed \nsweat. Sweat comes in two varieties, sensible and insensible sweat. \nIt begins as a protein-free filtrate of blood plasma. Sweat is about  \n99% water and 1% other chemicals, including some electrolytes (pri\nmarily sodium and chloride), metabolites (lactic acid), and waste prod\nucts (urea and ammonia). It is the sodium chloride that gives sweat a \nsalty taste.\n The major function of merocrine sweat glands is thermo- \n \nregulation, which is the regulation of body temperature by evapo\nration of fluid from the skin. Merocrine sweat gland secretions \nprovide a means for the loss of both water and electrolytes. The \nsecretions also may help eliminate a number of ingested drugs. \nFinally, merocrine sweat gland secretions provide some protection \nfrom environmental hazards both by diluting harmful chemicals \nCerumen\n Breast milk to nourish offspring\n and by preventing the growth of microorganisms (antibacterial and \nantifungal activity).\n Apocrine Sweat Glands Apocrine sweat glands are simple, \ncoiled, tubular glands that release their secretions into hair follicles at \nthe armpits (axillae), around the nipples (areola), in the groin (pubic \nregion), and around the anus (anal region). Originally, these glands \nwere named apocrine because their cells were thought to secrete \ntheir product by an apocrine mechanism (meaning that the apical \nportion of the cell’s cytoplasm pinches off and, along with cellular \ncomponents of the apical region, becomes the secretory product) (see \nsection 4.1f). However, researchers have shown that both apocrine \nand merocrine sweat glands produce their secretions by exocytosis. \nHowever, the secretory portion of an apocrine gland has a much \nlarger lumen than that of a merocrine gland ( figure 5.10c), so these \nglands continue to be called apocrine glands. The secretion they \nproduce is viscous, cloudy, and composed of proteins and lipids that \nare acted upon by bacteria, producing a distinct, noticeable odor. \n(Underarm deodorant is designed to mask the odor from the secre\ntory product of these glands.) Secretion is influenced by hormones \nand may function in both signaling and communication. These sweat \nglands become active and produce secretory product at puberty.\n Sebaceous Glands\n Sebaceous glands are holocrine glands (see section 4.1f) that dis\ncharge an oily, waxy secretion called sebum (sē′bŭm), usually into a \nhair follicle (figure 5.10a, d). Some sebaceous glands release sebum \ndirectly onto the skin. Sebum acts as a lubricant to keep the skin \nand hair from becoming dry, brittle, and cracked. Several sebaceous \nglands may open onto a single follicle by means of one or more short \nducts. Sebaceous glands are relatively inactive during childhood; \nhowever, they are activated during puberty in both sexes, when the \nproduction of sex hormones begins to increase. Sebaceous glands are \ndistributed over most of the body (except the palms and soles) and \nare most abundant on the face and scalp. They are typically larger \non and around the nose where they secrete larger volumes of sebum.\n Sebum has bactericidal (bacteria-killing) properties. However, \nunder some conditions, bacteria can cause an infection within the \nsebaceous gland and produce a local inflammation called folliculitis \n(fŏ-lik′yū-lī′tis). A blocked duct in a sebaceous gland often develops \ninto a distinctive abscess called a furuncle (fū′rŭng-kĕl; furunculus =\na petty thief), or boil. A furuncle is usually treated by lancing (cutting \nit open) to facilitate normal drainage and healing.\n Other Integumentary Glands\n Some specialized glands of the integument are restricted to specific \nlocations. Two important examples are the ceruminous glands and \nthe mammary glands.\n Ceruminous (sĕ-rū′mi-nŭs; cera = wax) glands are true apo\ncrine glands (see section 4.1f) located only in the external acoustic \nmeatus (external ear canal), where their secretion mixes with both \nsebum and exfoliated keratinocytes to form waterproof earwax called \ncerumen (sĕ-rū′men). There are about 1000 to 2000 of these glands \nin the external acoustic meatus. They are simple, coiled, tubular \nglands with ducts leading to the surface of the skin. Ceruminous \nglands differ from sweat glands in that they secrete cerumen via the \napocrine mechanism. Cerumen, together with tiny hairs along the ear \ncanal, helps trap foreign particles or small insects and keeps them \nfrom reaching the eardrum. Cerumen also lubricates the external \nacoustic meatus and eardrum. In addition, cerumen contains lyso\nzyme, an enzyme capable of destroying bacterial cell walls.\n The mammary glands of the breasts are modified apocrine \nsweat glands (see section 4.1f). Both males and females have mam\nmary glands, but these glands only become functional in pregnant \nfemales, when they produce a secretion (breast milk) that nourishes \noffspring. The development of the gland and the production of its \nsecretory products are controlled by a complex interaction between \ngonadal and pituitary hormones. The structure and function of mam\nmary glands are discussed in section 28.2f.\n\n\n### Table 5.3 Glands of the Skin\n| **Type**                     | **Glands of the Skin** | **Location** | **Products Secreted / Description** |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Sweat (Sudoriferous) Glands  | Apocrine sweat glands    | Distributed in axillary, anal, areolar, and pubic regions | Produce viscous, complex secretion; secretion influenced by hormones |\n| Sweat (Sudoriferous) Glands  | Merocrine sweat glands   | Distributed throughout body, except external genitalia, nipples, and lips; especially prevalent on palms, soles, and forehead | Produce nonviscous, watery secretion; controlled by nervous system; provide some antibacterial protection; function in thermoregulation and excretion; flush surface of epidermis |\n| Sebaceous Glands             | Sebaceous glands         | Associated with hair follicles | Produce lipid material called sebum, which coats epidermis and hair shaft; provides lubrication and antibacterial activity |\n| Other Glands                 | Ceruminous glands        | External acoustic meatus | Produce cerumen |\n| Other Glands                 | Mammary glands           | Breasts | Produce breast milk to nourish offspring |\n",

         "5 Integumentary System\n5.5 Integumentary Structures Derived from Epidermis\n5.5b Hair\n----------\n\n Hair is found almost everywhere on the body except the palms of the \nhands, the sides and soles of the feet, the lips, the sides of the fingers \nand toes, and portions of the external genitalia. Most of the hairs on \nthe human body are on the general body surface rather than the head. \nThe general structure of hair and its relationship to the integument \nare shown in figure 5.9.\n\nHair Type and Distribution\nA single hair is also called a pilus. It has the shape of a slender \nfilament, and is composed of keratinized cells growing from hair \nfollicles that extend deep into the dermis, often projecting into the \nunderlying subcutaneous layer. Differences in hair density are due \nprimarily to differences in its texture and  pigmentation.\n During our lives, we produce three kinds of hair: lanugo, \nvellus, and terminal hair. Lanugo (lă-nu′gō) is a fine, unpig\nmented, downy hair that first appears on the fetus in the second \ntrimester of development. At birth, most of the lanugo \nhas been replaced by similarly fine, unpigmented or \nlightly pigmented hair called vellus (vel′ŭs;  vellus =  \nfleece). Vellus is the primary human hair and is \nfound on most of the body. Terminal hair is \nusually coarser, pigmented, and longer than \nvellus. It grows on the scalp, and is also the \nhair of eyebrows and eyelashes. At puberty, \nterminal hair replaces vellus in the axil\nlary and pubic regions. Additionally, under \nthe influence of testosterone, terminal hair \nforms a beard.\n\nHair Structure and Follicles\n Three zones can be recognized along the length of a hair: the hair \nbulb, root, and shaft. The hair bulb consists of epithelial cells and \nis a swelling at the base where the hair originates in the dermis. The \nepithelium at the base of the bulb surrounds a small hair papilla, \nwhich is composed of a small amount of connective tissue containing \ntiny blood vessels and nerves. The root is the portion of the hair deep \nto the skin surface. The shaft is that portion of the hair that extends \nbeyond the skin surface. The hair bulb contains living epithelial cells, \nwhereas the root and shaft consist of dead epithelial cells.\n Hair production involves a specialized type of keratinization \nthat occurs in the hair matrix. Epithelial cells near the center of the \nhair matrix divide, producing new cells that are gradually pushed \ntoward the surface. The medulla, not found in all hair types, is a rem\nnant of the soft core of the matrix. It is composed of loosely arranged \ncells and air spaces, and contains flexible, soft keratin. Several layers \nof flattened cells closer to the outer surface of the developing hair \nform the relatively hard cortex. Multiple cell layers around the cortex \nform the cuticle, which coats the hair. The free edges of cuticle cells \nare directed externally.\n The hair root extends from the hair bulb to the region where the \nhair shaft is completely mature. The entire hair root lies  internal to \nthe skin, and the hair shaft extends from the hair root to the exposed \ntip of the hair. The hair shaft’s size, shape, and color can be highly \nvariable.\n\n The hair follicle (fol′i-kĕl; folliculus = a small sac) is an oblique \ntube that surrounds the root hair. The follicle always extends into the \ndermis and sometimes into the subcutaneous layer. The cells of the fol\nlicle walls are organized into two principal concentric layers: an outer \nconnective tissue root sheath, which originates from the dermis, and an \ninner epithelial tissue root sheath, which originates from the epidermis \n(figure 5.9b).\n Extending from the dermal papillae to the mid-region of the hair \nfollicles are thin ribbons of smooth muscle that are collectively called \nthe arrector pili (ă-rek′tōr pī′lī; arrector = to raise up, pilus = hair) \nmuscles. The arrector pili muscles are usually stimulated in response \nto an emotional state, such as fear or rage, or exposure to cold tem\nperatures. Upon stimulation, the arrector pili muscles contract, pulling \non the follicles and elevating the hairs, to produce “goose bumps.”\n Functions of Hair\n The millions of hairs distributed on the surface of the human body \nhave important functions that include the following:\n ■ Protection. The hair on the head protects the scalp from \nsunburn and injury. Hair within the nostrils entraps particles \nbefore they travel deeper into the respiratory system, whereas \nhairs within the external ear canal protect the ear from \ninsects and foreign particles. Eyelashes protect the eyes, and \neyebrows help prevent sweat on the forehead from dripping \ninto the eyes.\n - Heat retention. Hair on the head prevents the loss of \nconducted heat from the scalp to the surrounding air. \nIndividuals who have lost their scalp hair release much more \nheat through the scalp than those who have a full head  \nof hair. \n - Sensory reception. Hair has associated tactile receptors (hair \nroot plexuses) that detect light touch (see section 19.2a).\n - Visual identification. Hair characteristics are important in \ndetermining age and sex, and in identifying individuals.  \n(Hair analysis also assists in determining animal species.)\n Hair Color\n Hair color is a result of the synthesis of melanin in the matrix ad\njacent to the papillae. Variations in hair color reflect genetically \ndetermined differences in the structure of the melanin. Additionally, \nenvironmental and hormonal factors may influence the color of the \nhair. As people age, pigment production decreases, and thus hair \n becomes lighter in color. Gray hair results from the gradual reduction \nof melanin production within the hair follicle, whereas white hair \nsignifies a complete stoppage of melanin production. Usually, hair \ncolor changes gradually.\n Hair Growth Cycle\n There are three stages of the hair growth cycle: anagen, catagen, and \ntelogen:\n 1. The anagen phase is the active phase of growth where living \ncells of the hair bulb are rapidly growing, dividing, and \ntransforming into hair. It is the longest part of the growth cycle \nand lasts from about 18 months to as much as 7 years, depending \nupon the genetics of the person (e.g., people who can grow long \nhair have the longest anagen phase of the cycle). On the scalp, \nduring the anagen phase, each hair strand grows about one-third \nof a millimeter per day, or 0.5 to 1.0 centimeter per month. On a \nnormal scalp, 80% to 95% of follicles are in anagen phase.\n 2. The catagen phase is a brief regression period where cell \ndivision ceases. The follicle undergoes involution and shrinks \ntoward the scalp surface. This very short phase lasts for about \n3 to 4 weeks.\n ©Dr. P. Marazzi/Science Source\n 3. The telogen phase is the resting phase and is usually the phase \nwhere the hair is shed (these hairs are the ones we find in our \ncomb or brush). After 3 to 4 months in the telogen phase, the \ncells of the hair bulb are stimulated (stimulus unknown) to start \nregrowing, and the follicle reenters the anagen phase. \nThe hair growth rate and the duration of the hair growth cycle \nvary; however, the scalp normally loses between 10 and 100 hairs per \nday. Thus, this amount of hair loss shouldn’t cause noticeable thinning \nof the scalp hair. Continuous losses that exceed 100 hairs per day often \nindicate a health problem. Sometimes hair loss may be temporary as \na result of one or more of the following factors: certain medications, \ndietary factors, radiation, high fever, or stress. Thinning of the hair, \ncalled alopecia (al′ō-pē′shē-ă;  alopekia = a disease like fox mange), \ncan occur in both males and females, usually as a result of aging.  \nIn diffuse hair loss, hair is shed from all parts of the scalp. This con\ndition primarily affects genetic females, and may be due to hormones, \nmedications, or iron deficiency. \nThe condition called male pattern baldness causes loss of hair \nfirst from only the crown region of the scalp rather than uniformly. \nIt is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal influences. \nAt puberty, the testes begin secreting large quantities of male sex \nhormones (primarily testosterone). Male sex hormones produce a \ntypical pattern of underarm hair, facial hair, and chest hair. The rel\nevant gene for male pattern baldness has two alleles, one for uniform \nhair growth and one for baldness. The baldness allele is dominant in \ngenetic males and is expressed only in the presence of a high level of \ntestosterone. In genetic females, the baldness allele is recessive. Thus, \nthis trait is a sex-influenced trait, in which an allele is dominant in one \nsex (males) and recessive in the other (females). Changes in the level of \nthe sex hormones circulating in the blood can affect hair development \non the scalp, causing a shift from terminal hair to vellus production.\n Excessive hairiness in areas of the body that normally do \nnot have terminal hair is called hirsutism (her′sū-tizm; hirsutus = \nshaggy). This hair growth typically occurs on the face, chest, and \nback and may affect both sexes, but typically is more distressing for \nthose who identify as female. Hirsutism most commonly is caused by \nan excess of male sex hormones called androgens, either through a \nmedical condition (such as polycystic ovarian syndrome) or by certain \nmedications that cause a rise in androgens.\n",

         "4 Tissue Level of Organization\n4.1 Epithelial Tissue\n4.1f Glands\n----------\n\nAs epithelial tissue develops in the embryo, small invaginations \nfrom this epithelium into the underlying connective tissue give \nrise to specialized secretory structures called glands. Glands are \neither individual cells or multicellular organs composed predomi\nnantly of epithelial tissue. They secrete substances either for use \nelsewhere in the body or for elimination from the body. Glandular \nsecretions include mucin, electolytes, hormones, enzymes, and \nwaste products.\n Endocrine and Exocrine Glands\n Glands are classified as either endocrine or exocrine, depending upon \nwhether they have a duct connecting the secretory cells to the surface \nof an epithelium.\n Endocrine (en′dō-krin; endon = within, krino = to separate) \nglands lack ducts and secrete their products directly into the inter\nstitial fluid and blood. The secretions of endocrine glands, called \nhormones, act as chemical messengers to influence cell activities \nelsewhere in the body. Endocrine glands are discussed in depth in \nsection 20.1.\n\n Exocrine (ek′sō-krin; exo = outside) glands typically origi\nnate from an invagination of epithelium that burrows into the deeper \nconnective tissues. These glands usually maintain their contact with \nthe epithelial surface by means of a duct, an epithelium-lined tube \nthrough which secretions of the gland are discharged onto the epithe\nlial surface. This duct may secrete materials onto the surface of the \nskin (e.g., sweat from sweat glands or milk from mammary glands) \nor onto an epithelial surface lining an internal passageway (e.g., en\nzymes from the pancreas into the small intestine or saliva from the \nsalivary glands into the oral cavity).\n Exocrine Gland Structure\n An exocrine gland may be unicellular or multicellular. A unicel\nlular exocrine gland is an individual exocrine cell located within \nan epithelium that is predominantly nonsecretory. Unicellular exo\ncrine glands do not contain a duct, and they are located close to the \nsurface of the epithelium in which they reside. The most common \ntype of unicellular exocrine gland is the goblet cell (figure 4.4). It \nis usually found in both a simple columnar epithelium and pseu\ndostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. For example, the respi\nratory tract is lined mainly by pseudostratified ciliated columnar \nepithelium, which also contains some mucin-secreting goblet cells. \nMucus then coats the inner surface of the respiratory passageway \nto cover and protect its lining and to help warm, humidify, and \ncleanse the inhaled air before it reaches the gas exchange surfaces \nin the lungs.\n Multicellular exocrine glands are composed of numerous cells \nthat work together to produce a secretion and secrete it onto the sur\nface of an epithelium. The gland consists of secretory portions, often \nacini (as′i-nī; sing., as′i-nŭs; acinus = grape), that produce the secre\ntion, and one or more smaller ducts (the conducting portion), which \nmerge to eventually form a larger duct that transports the secretion \nto the epithelial surface (figure 4.5). \nMost multicellular exocrine glands are enclosed within a fi\nbrous capsule. Extensions of this capsule, called septa or trabeculae, \npartition the gland internally into compartments called lobes. Further \nsubdivisions of the septa within each lobe form microscopic lobules \n(lob′yūl). The septa contain ducts, blood vessels, and nerves supply\ning the gland. The connective tissue framework of the gland is called \nthe stroma. The stroma supports and organizes the parenchyma \n(pă-reng′ki-mă), the functional cells of the gland that produce and \nsecrete the gland products. These cells are usually simple cuboidal\n or columnar epithelial cells. Multicellular exocrine glands occur in \nthe mammary glands, pancreas, and salivary glands.\n\nFigure 4.5\n General Structure of Multicellular Exocrine Glands. (a) Exocrine glands \nhave a connection called a duct that leads to an organ or body surface. Inside \nthe gland, the duct branches repeatedly, following the connective tissue septa, \nuntil its finest divisions end on secretory acini. (b) The acinus is the secretory \nportion of the gland, and the duct is the conducting portion.\n\nClassification of Exocrine Glands\n Multicellular exocrine glands may be classified according to three \ncriteria: (1) form and structure (morphology), which is considered \nan anatomic classification; (2) type of secretion; and (3) method of \nsecretion. The latter two are considered physiologic classifications.\n Form and Structure Exocrine glands are considered either simple \nor compound based upon the structure and complexity of their ducts. \nSimple glands have a single, unbranched duct; compound glands \nexhibit branched ducts.\n Exocrine glands are also classified according to the shape or \norganization of their secretory portions. If the secretory portion and \nthe duct are of uniform diameter, the gland is called tubular. If the \nsecretory cells form an expanded sac, the gland is called acinar \n(as′i-năr). Finally, a gland with both secretory tubules and secretory \nacini is called a tubuloacinar gland. Figure 4.6 shows the several \ntypes of exocrine glands as classified by morphology.\n Secretion Types Exocrine glands are classified by the nature of \ntheir secretions as serous glands, mucous glands, or mixed glands. \nSerous (sē′rŭs; serum = whey) glands produce and secrete a non\nviscous, watery fluid, such as sweat, milk, tears, or digestive juices. \nThis fluid carries wastes (sweat) to the surface of the skin, nutrients \n(milk) to a nursing infant, or digestive enzymes from the pancreas to \nthe lumen of the small intestine. Mucous (myū′kŭs) glands secrete \nmucin, which forms mucus when mixed with water. Mucous glands \noccur in such places as the roof of the oral cavity and the surface of \nthe tongue. Mixed glands, such as the two pairs of salivary glands \ninferior to the oral cavity, contain both serous and mucous cells, and \nproduce a mixture of the two types of secretions.\n Secretion Methods Glands are also classified by their mechanism of \ndischarging secretory product as merocrine glands, holocrine glands, or \napocrine glands (figure 4.7).\n Merocrine (mer′ō-krin; meros = share) glands package their \nsecretions in structures called secretory vesicles and release their \nsecretion by exocytosis. The cells remain intact and are not damaged \nin any way by producing the secretion. Lacrimal (tear) glands, sali\nvary glands, sweat glands, the exocrine glands of the pancreas, and \nthe gastric glands of the stomach are examples of merocrine glands. \nSome merocrine glands are also called eccrine glands, to denote a \ntype of sweat gland in the skin that is not connected to a hair follicle \n(see section 5.5c). \nApocrine (ap′ō-krin; apo = away from or off) glands are \ncomposed of cells that accumulate their secretory products within \nthe apical portion of their cytoplasm. Secretion occurs when the cell’s \napical portion pinches off, releasing cytoplasmic content. Thereafter,  \nthe cell repairs itself in order to repeat its secretory activity. Mam\nmary glands and ceruminous glands are apocrine glands. \n\nFigure 4.6\n Structural Classification of Multicellular Exocrine Glands. (a) Simple glands have unbranched ducts, whereas (b) compound glands have ducts that branch. \nThese glands also exhibit different forms: Tubular glands have secretory cells in a space with a uniform diameter, acinar glands have secretory cells arranged in \nsaclike acini, and tubuloacinar glands have secretory cells in both acinar and tubular regions\n\n Figure 4.7\n Modes of Exocrine Secretion. Exocrine glands use different processes to release their secretory products. (a) Merocrine glands secrete products by means \nof exocytosis at the apical surface of the secretory cells. (b) Apocrine gland secretion occurs with the “decapitation” of the apical surface of the cell and the \nsubsequent release of secretory product and some cellular fragments. (c) Holocrine gland secretion is produced through the destruction of the secretory cell.  \nLost cells are replaced by cell division at the base of the gland.\n\nHolocrine (hol′ō-krin; holos = whole) glands are formed from \ncells that accumulate a product and then the entire cell disintegrates. \nThus, a holocrine secretion is a viscous mixture of cell fragments and \nthe product the cell synthesized prior to its destruction. The ruptured, \ndead cells are continuously replaced by other epithelial cells undergo\ning mitosis. The oil-producing glands (sebaceous glands) in the skin \nare an example of holocrine glands. (So the oily secretion you feel on \nyour skin is actually composed of ruptured, dead cells!)\n",

         "7 Axial Skeleton\n7.1 Skull\n7.1d Bones of the Face\n----------\n\nThe facial bones (see figure 7.2) give shape and individuality to the \nface, form part of the orbit and nasal cavities, support the teeth, and \nprovide for the attachment of muscles involved in facial expression \nand mastication. There are 14 facial bones, including the paired zy\ngomatic bones, lacrimal bones, nasal bones, inferior nasal conchae, \npalatine bones, and maxillae, and the unpaired vomer and mandible \n(table 7.3).\n Zygomatic Bones\n The zygomatic bones, commonly referred to as the “cheekbones,” \nform part of the lateral wall of each orbit and the cheeks (figure 7.18). \nA prominent zygomatic arch is formed by the articulation of the tem\nporal process of each zygomatic bone with the zygomatic process of \neach temporal bone (see figure 7.6). The bone also has a maxillary \n(mak′si-lār-ē) process, which articulates with the zygomatic process \nof the maxilla, and a frontal process, which articulates with the \nfrontal bone. The orbital surface of the zygomatic bone forms the \nlateral wall of the orbit.\n Lacrimal Bones\n The small, paired lacrimal (lak′ri-măl; lacrima = a tear) bones \nform part of the medial wall of each orbit (see figure 7.4). A small, \ndepressed inferior opening called the lacrimal groove provides a \npassageway for the nasolacrimal duct, which drains tears into the \nnasal cavity (see section 19.5a).\n Nasal Bones\n The paired nasal bones form the bridge of the nose (see figure 7.4). \nThe medial edge of each maxilla articulates with the lateral edge of a \nnasal bone. The nasal bones are often fractured by blows to the nose.\n Vomer\n The vomer (vō′mĕr; plowshare) has a triangular shape, and \nwhen viewed laterally, resembles a farming plow (figure 7.19). \nIt articulates along its midline with both the maxillae and the \npalatine bones. Its curved, thin, horizontal projection, called the \nala, meaning “wing,” articulates superiorly with the sphenoid \nbone. The vertical plate of the vomer articulates with the per\npendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. Anteriorly, both the vomer \nand the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone form the bony \nnasal septum.\n\nInferior Nasal Conchae\n The inferior nasal conchae are located in the inferolateral wall of the \nnasal cavity (see figure 7.15). They are similar to the superior and middle \nnasal conchae of the ethmoid bone in that they help create turbulence in \n inhaled air. However, inferior nasal conchae are separate bones, whereas \nthe middle and superior nasal conchae are parts of the ethmoid bone.\n Palatine Bones\n The palatine (pal′ă-tīn) bones are small bones with a distinct \nL shape. They form part of the hard palate, nasal cavity, and eye \norbit (figure 7.20). The posterior portion of the hard palate is \nformed by the horizontal plate of the palatine bone, which articu\nlates anteriorly with the palatine process of the maxilla. Greater \nand lesser palatine foramina perforate this horizontal plate (see \nfigure 7.8). Nerves to the palate and upper teeth travel through these \npalatine formina. The perpendicular plate forms part of the lateral \nwall of the nasal cavity. The most superior part of the perpendicular \nplate has an orbital process that forms a small part of the medial \nfloor of the orbit.\n Maxillae\n The paired maxillae (mak-sil′ē; sing., maxilla, mak-sil′ă; jawbone), \nalso called maxillary bones, form the central part of the facial skel\neton (figure 7.21). Left and right maxillae unite to form the upper \njaw. Together, the united maxillae form a prominent anterior nasal \nspine along the inferior surface of the nasal cavity. Each maxilla \ncontains an infraorbital margin and an inferior orbital surface. A \nlarge infraorbital foramen provides passage for a blood vessel and \nnerve (infraorbital artery and nerve). Within the orbit, this  foramen \nextends along the infraorbital groove. The inferior portions of the \nmaxillae contain the alveolar (al-vē′ō-lăr) processes that house the \nupper teeth.\n\n Most of the hard palate is formed anteriorly by horizontal \nmedial extensions of both maxillae, called palatine processes \n(see figure 7.21b). Near the anterior margin of the fused palatine \nprocesses, immediately posterior to the teeth called incisors, is an \nincisive foramen. This foramen is a passageway for branches of the \nnasopalatine nerve. Lateral to the nasal cavity, each maxilla contains \na large, spacious cavity called the maxillary sinus. Laterally, each \nmaxilla articulates with a zygomatic bone via a zygomatic process. \nSuperiorly, the maxillae articulate with the frontal bones via frontal \nprocesses (see figure 7.21a).\nMandible\n The mandible (man′di-bŭl) forms the entire lower jaw (figure 7.22). \nIt supports the inferior teeth and provides attachment for the \nmuscles of mastication. The mandible has a horizontal body and \ntwo vertical-to-oblique ascending posterior regions called the rami \n(rā′mī; sing., ramus, rā′mŭs). The teeth are supported by the al\nveolar process of the mandibular body. Each ramus intersects the \nbody at a “corner” called the angle of the mandible. The point \nof the chin is the mental (mentum = chin)  protuberance. On the \nanterolateral surface of the body, a mental foramen  penetrates the \nbody on each side of the chin to provide a passageway for nerves \nand blood vessels.\n An alveolar process covers both the alveoli and the roots of the \nteeth medially in the mandible. On the medial aspect of the ramus, \na prominent mandibular foramen provides a passage way for blood \nvessels and nerves that innervate the inferior teeth.\nThe posterior projection of each mandibular ramus, called \nthe condylar (kon′di-lăr) process, terminates at the head of the \nmandible, also called the mandibular condyle (kon′dīl). Each \narticulation of the head of the mandible with the mandibular \nfossa of the temporal bone is called the temporomandibular \njoint (TMJ), a mobile joint that allows us to move the lower jaw \nwhen we talk or chew (see section 9.5a). The anterior projection \nof the ramus, termed the coronoid (kōr′ŏ-noyd; korōnē = a crow) \nprocess, is the insertion point for the temporalis muscle, a pow\nerful muscle involved in closing the mouth (see section 11.1c). \nThe U-shaped depression between the two processes is called the \nmandibular notch.\n\n\n### Table 7.3 Facial Bones and Selected Features\n| **Bone and Associated Passageways** | **Description and Boundaries of Bone** | **Selected Features and Their Functions** |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Zygomatic bones** | Each forms the cheek and lateral part of the orbit | Frontal process: Articulates with frontal bone<br>Maxillary process: Articulates with maxilla<br>Temporal process: Articulates with temporal bone to form zygomatic arch |\n| **Lacrimal bones** | Each forms part of the medial wall of the orbit | Lacrimal groove: Contains nasolacrimal duct |\n| **Nasal bones** | Each forms the anterosuperior bridge of the nose | — |\n| **Vomer** | Forms inferior and posterior parts of nasal septum | Ala: Articulates with sphenoid bone<br>Vertical plate: Articulates with perpendicular plate of ethmoid bone |\n| **Inferior nasal conchae** | Curved bones that project from lateral walls of the nasal cavity | Increase airflow turbulence in nasal cavity |\n| **Palatine bones** | Greater and lesser palatine foramina; forms posterior part of hard palate; small part of nasal cavity and orbit wall | Horizontal plate: Forms posterior part of palate<br>Perpendicular plate: Forms part of nasal cavity and orbit |\n| **Maxillae** | Incisive foramen, Infraorbital foramen; forms anterior portion of face, upper jaw, parts of hard palate, inferior orbits, and part of nasal walls | Alveolar process: Houses the teeth<br>Frontal process: Forms part of lateral aspect of nasal bridge<br>Infraorbital margin: Forms inferolateral border of orbit<br>Maxillary sinus: Lightens bone<br>Palatine process: Forms most of bony palate<br>Zygomatic process: Articulates with zygomatic bone |\n| **Mandible** | Mandibular foramen, Mental foramen; forms the lower jaw | Alveolar process: Houses the teeth<br>Coronoid process: Attachment of temporalis muscle<br>Head of mandible: Articulates with temporal bone<br>Mental protuberance: Forms the chin<br>Mylohyoid line: Attachment site for mylohyoid muscle |\n",

         "5 Integumentary System\n5.2 Epidermis\n5.2a Epidermal Strata\n----------\n\nCareful examination of the epidermis, from the basement membrane \nto its surface, reveals several layers, or strata. From deep to superfi\ncial, these layers are the stratum basale, the stratum spinosum, the \nstratum granulosum, the stratum lucidum (found in thick skin only), \nand the stratum corneum (figure 5.2). The first three strata listed are \ncomposed of living keratinocytes, whereas the most superficial two \nstrata contain dead keratinocytes.\n Stratum Basale\n The deepest epidermal layer is the stratum basale (strat′ŭm bah-sā′lē) \n(also known as the stratum germinativum or basal layer). This single \nlayer of cells ranges from cuboidal to low columnar in appearance. It is \ntightly attached to an underlying basement membrane that separates the \nepidermis from the connective tissue of the adjacent dermis. Three types \nof cells occupy the stratum basale (figure 5.2b):\n 1. Keratinocytes (ke-rat′i-nō-sīt; keras = horn) are the most \nabundant cell type in the epidermis and occur throughout \nall epidermal strata. The stratum basale is dominated by \nlarge keratinocyte stem cells, which divide to provide both\nreplacement stem cells and new keratinocytes that replace \nthe dead keratinocytes shed from the surface. Their name is \nderived from their role in the synthesis of the protein keratin \n(ker′ă-tin) in the epidermal cells of the skin. Keratin is a family \nof fibrous structural proteins that are both tough and insoluble. \nFibrous keratin molecules can twist and intertwine around each \nother to form helical intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton \n(see section 2.4c). The keratins found in epidermal cells of the \nskin are called cytokeratins. Their structure in these cells gives \nskin its strength and makes the epidermis almost waterproof.\n 2. Melanocytes (mel′ă-nō-sīt; melano = black) have long, \nbranching cytoplasmic processes and are scattered among the \nkeratinocytes of the stratum basale. They produce and store \nthe pigment melanin (mel′ă-nin) in response to ultraviolet \n(UV) light expo sure. The cells’ cytoplasmic processes transfer \npigment granules, called melanosomes (mel′ă-nō-sōmes), by \nphagocytosis or exocytosis, into the keratinocytes within the \nbasal layer and sometimes within more superficial layers. This \npigment (black, brown, or yellow-brown) accumulates around \nthe nucleus of the keratinocyte and shields the DNA within the \nnucleus from ultraviolet radiation. The darker tones of the skin \nresult from melanin being produced by the melanocytes and \nfrom the darkening of melanin already present upon exposure \nto ultraviolet light.\n 3. Tactile cells (also known as Merkel cells) are few in number \nand found scattered among the cells within the stratum basale. \nTactile cells are sensitive to touch, and when compressed, they \nrelease chemicals that stimulate sensory nerve endings, providing \ninformation about objects touching the skin (see section 19.2a).\n\nStratum Spinosum\n Several layers of polygonal keratinocytes form the stratum spinosum  \n(spi-nō′sŭm), or spiny layer. Each time a keratinocyte stem cell in \nthe stratum basale divides, the new cell is pushed toward the external \nsurface. Once this new cell enters the stratum spinosum, the cell begins\nto differentiate into a nondividing, highly specialized keratinocyte. The \nnondividing keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum attach to their neigh\nbors by many intercellular junctions called desmosomes (described in \nsection 4.1c). The process of preparing epidermal tissue for observation \non a microscope slide shrinks the cytoplasm of the cells in the stratum \nspinosum. Because the cytoskeletal elements and desmosomes remain \nintact, the shrunken stratum spinosum cells resemble miniature porcu\npines attached to their neighbors. These bridges between neighboring \ncells provide a spiny appearance, explaining the name of the layer.\n In addition to the keratinocytes, the stratum spinosum also \ncontains the fourth epidermal cell type, the epidermal dendritic cells \n(figure 5.2b). Epidermal dendritic cells are immune cells that help \nfight infection in the epidermis. These cells are often present but \nnot easily identifiable in both the stratum spinosum and the more \nsuperficial stratum granulosum. Their phagocytic activity initiates \nan immune response to protect the body against pathogens that have \npenetrated the superficial layers of the epidermis as well as against \nepidermal cancer cells.\nStratum Granulosum\n The stratum granulosum (gran-ū-lō′sum), or granular layer, consists \nof three to five layers of keratinocytes superficial to the stratum spino\nsum. There are two types of granules in the stratum granulosum: ker\natohyalin granules, which are involved in the keratinization process, \nand lamellar granules, which fuse with the plasma membrane and \nextrude their contents (lipids primarily) into the extracellular space. \nThe lipids are important in the prevention of water loss (by serving \nas a water barrier) and protective functions of the skin. Within this \nstratum begins a process called keratinization (ker′ă-tin-i-zā′shŭn), \nby which the keratinocytes fill up with the protein keratin. Several \nsignificant events occur during keratinization. As the cells pass \nthrough the stratum granulosum and true keratin filaments (inter\nmediate filaments of the cytoskeleton) begin to develop, the cells \nbecome thinner and flatter. Their membranes thicken and become \nless permeable. The nucleus and all organelles disintegrate, and the \ncells start to die. Subsequently, the dehydrated material left within \nthe cells forms a tightly interlocked layer of keratin fibers sandwiched \nbetween thickened phospholipid membranes. Keratinization is not \ncomplete until the cells reach the more superficial epidermal lay\ners. A fully keratinized cell is dead (because it has neither a nucleus  \nnor organelles), but it is strong because it contains keratin.\n Stratum Lucidum\n The stratum lucidum (lū′sĭ-dum), or clear layer, is a thin, translucent \nregion about two to three cell layers thick that is superficial to the stratum \ngranulosum. This stratum is found only in thick skin, such as the palms \nof the hands and the soles of the feet. Cells occupying this layer appear \npale and featureless, and have indistinct boundaries. The keratinocytes \nwithin this layer are flattened and filled with the protein eleidin \n(ē-lē′ī-din), an intermediate product in the process of keratin maturation.\n Stratum Corneum\n The stratum corneum (kōr′nē-ŭm; corneus = horny), or hornlike \nlayer, is the most superficial layer of the epidermis. It is the stratum \nyou see when you look at your skin. The stratum corneum consists \nof about 20 to 30 layers of dead, scaly, interlocking keratinized cells \ncalled  corneocytes (kōr′nē-ō-sīt). The dead cells are anucleate (lack\ning a nucleus) and tightly packed together.\n A keratinized (or cornified) epithelium contains large amounts \nof keratin. After keratinocytes are formed from stem cells within the \nstratum basale, they change in structure and in their relationship to \n their neighbors as they move through the different strata until they \neventually reach the stratum corneum and are sloughed off from its \nexternal surface. Migration of the keratinocyte to the stratum cor\nneum from the stratum basale occurs during the first 2 weeks of the \nkeratinocyte’s life. The dead, keratinized cells usually remain for an \nadditional 2 weeks in the exposed stratum corneum layer, providing a \nbarrier for cells deeper in the epidermis before they are shed, washed \naway, or removed by abrasion. Overall, keratinocytes are present for \nabout 1 month following their formation.\n The normally dry stratum corneum presents a thickened sur\nface unsuitable for the growth of many microorganisms. Addition\nally, some secretions onto the surface of the epidermis from exocrine \nglands help prevent the growth of microorganisms on the epidermis, \nthus supporting its barrier function.\n",

         "5 Integumentary System\n5.2 Epidermis\n5.2b Variations in the Epidermis\n----------\n\n The epidermis exhibits variations among different body regions \nwithin a single individual, as well as differences between individuals. \nThe epidermis varies in thickness, coloration, and skin markings.\n Thick Skin Versus Thin Skin\n Skin is classified as either thick or thin based upon the number of \nstrata in the epidermis and the relative thickness of the epidermis, \nrather than the thickness of the entire integument (figure 5.3).\n Thick skin is found on the palms of the hands, the soles of the \nfeet, and corresponding surfaces of the fingers and toes. All five epi\ndermal strata occur in thick skin. The epidermis of thick skin ranges \nbetween 0.4 mm and 0.6 mm thick. Thick skin contains sweat glands, \nbut no hair follicles or sebaceous (oil) glands. \nThin skin covers most of the body. The epidermis lacks the stra\ntum lucidum, so it has only four layers. Thin skin contains the following \naccessories: hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. The epi\ndermis of thin skin ranges from 0.075 mm to 0.150 mm thick.\n\n Why does thick skin lack hair follicles and sebaceous glands? \nThink about the locations where thick skin is found and how \nthe presence of hair follicles and sebaceous glands might \ninterfere with the function of thick skin in those areas.\n Skin Color\n Normal skin color results from a combination of hemoglobin, mela\nnin, and carotene. Hemoglobin (hē-mō-glō′bin; haima = blood) is \nan oxygen-binding protein present within red blood cells (see sec\ntion 21.3a). Hemoglobin exhibits a bright red color upon binding to \noxygen, giving blood vessels in the dermis a bright reddish tint that is \nmost easily seen in the skin of lightly pigmented individuals.\n Melanin is a pigment produced and stored in melanocytes \n(figure 5.4; see figure 5.2b). There are two types of melanin, eumelanin \n and pheomelanin, and they occur in various ratios of yellow, reddish, tan, \nbrown, and black shades. Recall that melanin is transferred in membrane\nbound vesicles from melanocytes to keratinocytes in the stratum basale \nand stratum spinosum via phagocytosis or exocytosis. The keratinocytes \nthat receive the melanin are displaced toward the stratum corneum, and \nthus melanocyte activity affects the color of the entire epidermis.\n The amount of melanin in the skin is determined by both he\nredity and light exposure. All people have about the same number of \nmelanocytes. However, melanocyte activity and the color of the mela\nnin produced by these cells varies among individuals and ethnicities, \nresulting in different skin color tones. Darker-skinned individuals have \nmelanocytes that produce relatively more and darker melanin than do \nlighter-skinned individuals. Further, these more active melanocytes \npackage melanin into cells in the more superficial epidermal layers, \nsuch as the stratum granulosum. Recall that exposure to ultraviolet \n(UV) light stimulates melanocytes to produce more melanin.\n Carotene (kar′ō-tēn) is a yellow-orange pigment that is acquired \nin the body by eating various yellow-orange vegetables, such as carrots, \ncorn, and squash. Normally, carotene accumulates inside keratinocytes \nof the stratum corneum and within the  subcutaneous layer. In the body, \ncarotene is converted into vitamin A, which has an important function \nin normal vision. Additionally, carotene has been implicated in reducing \nthe number of potentially dangerous molecules formed during normal \nmetabolic activity and in improving immune cell number and activity.\n Table 5.1 describes some abnormalities in skin color\n Skin Markings\n A nevus (nē′vŭs; pl., nē′vī; naevus = mole, birthmark), commonly \ncalled a mole, is a harmless, localized overgrowth of melanin-forming \ncells. Almost everyone is born with a few nevi, and some people \nhave as many as 20 or more. On rare occasions, a nevus may become \nmalignant, typically as a consequence of excessive UV light expo\nsure. Thus, nevi should be monitored for changes that may suggest \nmalignancy. Freckles are yellowish or brown spots that represent \nlocalized areas of excessive melanocyte activity, not an increase in \nmelanocyte numbers. A freckle’s degree of pigmentation varies and \ndepends upon both sun exposure and heredity.\n A hemangioma (hē-man′jē-ō′mă; angio = vessel, oma = tumor) \nis a congenital anomaly that results in skin discoloration due to blood ves\nsels that proliferate and form a benign tumor. Capillary hemangiomas, \nor strawberry-colored birthmarks, appear in the skin as bright red to \ndeep purple nodules that usually disappear in childhood. However, \ntheir development may occur in adults. Cavernous hemangiomas, also \nknown as port wine stains, involve larger dermal blood vessels and may \nlast a lifetime.\n The contours of the skin surface follow ridge patterns, varying \nfrom small, conical pegs (in thin skin) to complex arches and whorls \n(in thick skin) called friction ridges. Friction ridges occur on the \nfingers (called fingerprints), palms, soles, and toes (figure 5.5). These \nridges are formed from large folds and valleys of both the dermis and \nepidermis. With the help of moisture from merocrine sweat glands, \nfriction ridges increase friction so that objects do not slip easily from \nour hands and our feet do not slip on the floor when we walk barefoot. \nSome researchers have suggested friction ridges also provide flexibil\nity to the skin and allow it to deform without being damaged. When \nsweat and oil glands release their secretions, friction ridges can leave \nnoticeable prints on touched surfaces. The study of friction ridge pat\nterns is known as dermatoglyphics (derma = skin, glyph = carving). \nFriction ridge patterns are well formed by the fourth month of fetal \ndevelopment, and are a unique identifier because no two individuals \nshare the same set of fingerprints. Thus, dermatoglyphics is a valu\nable identification tool for law enforcement.\n\n### Table 5.1 Abmormal Skin Colors\n| **Name**     | **Description** | **Cause(s)** |\n|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Albinism     | Hair is white, skin is pale, irises of eyes are pink | Lack of melanin production; inherited recessive condition in which the enzyme needed to synthesize melanin is nonfunctional, so melanocytes cannot produce melanin |\n| Bronzing     | Skin appears golden-brown, copper, or bronze in color | Glucocorticoid hormone deficiency in the adrenal cortex; Addison disease |\n| Cyanosis     | Skin appears bluish as a result of oxygen deficiency in circulating blood | Airway obstruction, emphysema, or respiratory arrest; also results from exposure to cold weather or from cardiac arrest with slow blood flow |\n| Erythema     | Skin appears abnormally red | Exercise, sunburn, excess heat, emotions (anger or embarrassment) resulting in increased blood flow in dilated blood vessels in the dermis |\n| Hematoma     | A bruise (visible pool of clotted blood) is observable through the skin | Usually due to trauma (a blow to the skin); also may be indicative of hemophilia or a nutritional or metabolic disorder |\n| Jaundice     | Skin and sclera (white of the eyes) appear yellowish | Elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood; often occurs when normal liver function is disrupted, and in premature infants whose liver function is not yet sufficient |\n| Pallor       | Skin appears ashen, pale due to white collagen fibers housed within the dermis | Decreased blood flow to the skin; occurs as a result of low blood pressure, cold temperature, emotional stress, severe anemia, or circulatory shock |\n\n",

         "3 Embryology\n3.2 Gametogenesis\n3.2a Meiosis\n----------\n\n Meiosis (mī-ōʹsis; meiosis = lessening) is sex cell division; it be\ngins with a diploid parent cell and produces four haploid daughter \ncells called gametes. Mitosis (somatic cell division, described in \nsection 2.6) and meiosis (sex cell division) differ in the following ways: \n- Mitosis produces two daughter cells that are genetically \nidentical to the parent cell. In contrast, meiosis produces four \ndaughter cells that are genetically different from the parent cell.\n- Mitosis produces daughter cells that are diploid, whereas \nmeiosis produces daughter cells that are haploid.\n- Meiosis includes a process called crossing over, whereby genetic \nmaterial is exchanged between homologous chromosomes.\n\n Crossing over helps “shuffle the genetic deck of cards,” so to speak. \nThus, crossing over is a means of combining different genes from \nboth parents on one of the homologous chromosomes. Crossing over \ndoes not occur in mitosis. \nMeiosis begins with a diploid parent cell located in the gonad \n(ovary or testis). In this cell, 23 chromosomes came from the organ\nism’s mother (23 maternal chromosomes), and 23 came from the \nfather (23 paternal chromosomes). To produce haploid gametes, this \nparent cell must undergo meiosis.\n\nThe cell phase called interphase occurs prior to meiosis. Dur\ning interphase, the DNA in each chromosome is replicated, or dupli\ncated, in the parent cell. These replicated chromosomes (also known \nas double-stranded chromosomes) are composed of two identical \nstructures called sister chromatids (krō’ mă-tid; chromo = color,  \nid = resembling). Each sister chromatid contains an identical copy of \nDNA at this point. The sister chromatids are attached at a specialized \nregion termed the centromere. \nNote that sister chromatids are not the same as a “pair” of chro\nmosomes. A chromosome composed of sister chromatids resembles \na written letter X, whereas a homologous pair of chromosomes is \ncomposed of a matching maternal chromosome and paternal chro\nmosome, which are not attached at a centromere. Therefore, after \ninterphase, there are 23 pairs of replicated chromosomes. To assist \nyou with this terminology, please refer to table 3.1. \nOnce the DNA is replicated in interphase, the phases of meiosis \nbegin (figure 3.2). Meiosis is comprised of two separate sequential \nevents: meiosis I and meiosis II.\n\n\nMeiosis I: Reduction Division\n During meiosis I (also known as the first meiotic division), the homolo\ngous pairs of chromosomes are separated when the cell divides. The \nresult is two cells, each of which contains 23 chromosomes only (not \n23 pairs) that consist of duplicated sister chromatids held together at a \ncentromere. Because meiosis I results in the reduction of the number of \nchromosomes in the daughter cells, it is also called reduction division. \nMeiosis I consists of four phases plus cytokinesis, described next.\n Prophase I Homologous replicated chromosomes in the parent \ncell pair up to form a tetrad. (Keep in mind that each chromosome \nhere consists of two sister chromatids.) The process by which homo- \nlogous chromosomes pair up is called synapsis (si-nap’ sis; syn =  \ntogether).\n As the maternal and paternal chromosomes come close to\ngether, crossing over occurs. The homologous chromosomes within \neach tetrad exchange genetic material at this time. A portion of the \ngenetic material in a sister chromatid of a maternal chromosome is \nexchanged with the same portion of genetic material in a sister chro\nmatid of a paternal chromosome. This shuffling of the genetic mate\nrial ensures continued genetic diversity in new organisms. (Note that \nafter crossing over, the sister chromatids in a replicated chromosome \nare no longer identical.) Prophase I ends with the breakdown of the \nnuclear envelope.\n Metaphase I The homologous pairs of each tetrad line up on either \nside of the midline or equator of the cell, forming a double line of \nchromosomes. This alignment of paired chromosomes is random \nwith respect to whether the original maternal or paternal chromo\nsome of a pair is on one side of the equator or the other. For example, \nsome maternal chromosomes may be to the left of the equator, while \nthe remaining maternal chromosomes may be to the right. This ran\ndom alignment of homologous chromosomes is called independent \nassortment. \nSpindle fibers formed by microtubules extend from centrioles \nat opposite ends of the cell and attach to the centromere of each ho\nmologous replicated chromosome.\nAnaphase I The homologous pairs of chromosomes separate and \nare pulled to the opposite ends of the cell. Thus, a maternal chro\nmosome consisting of two sister chromatids is pulled to one side \nof the cell, while the homologous paternal chromosome is pulled \nto the opposite side. The process by which maternal and paternal \nchromosome pairs are separated and move to opposite ends of the \ncell is referred to as reduction division, because each daughter cell \nreceives only one-half the starting number of chromosomes (only \n23 chromosomes of the original 23 pairs). Note that the pairs of \nchromosomes are no longer together; however, each replicated chro\nmosome still consists of two sister chromatids. In addition, recognize \nthat not all maternal chromosomes are pulled to the same side of the \ncell; because of independent assortment, there is a random alignment \nof maternal and paternal chromosomes.\n Telophase I and Cytokinesis The replicated chromosomes arrive \nat opposite ends of the cell, and then a nuclear membrane may re-form \naround these chromosomes. A cleavage furrow forms in the cell, and \nthe cell cytoplasm divides (cytokinesis) to produce two new cells. Each \ndaughter cell now contains 23 replicated chromosomes only, but each \nreplicated chromosome is still composed of two sister chromatids \nbound together.\n The two cells formed in this stage must undergo another round \nof cell division, meiosis II, to separate the sister chromatids.\n Meiosis II: Separation of Sister Chromatids\n After meiosis I, the two daughter cells formed each contain 23 rep\nlicated chromosomes consisting of two connected sister chromatids. \nIn meiosis II (also known as the second meiotic division), these \nchromatids separate and become single chromosomes in haploid \ncells.\n Prophase II The second prophase event of meiosis resembles the \nprophase stage of mitosis. In each of the two new cells, the nuclear \nenvelope breaks down, and the chromosomes collect together. \nHowever, crossing over does not occur in this phase because no \nhomologous chromosome pairs are present; they were separated in \nanaphase I.\n Metaphase II Spindle fibers extend from the centrioles to the cen\ntromere of each chromatid. The replicated chromosomes (composed of \nsister chromatids) are aligned to form a single line along the equator in \nthe middle of the cell.\n Anaphase II The sister chromatids of each replicated chromosome \nare pulled apart at the centromere and are now separated. Each sister \nchromatid is now called a single chromosome (or single-stranded \nchromosome) and is pulled to the opposite pole of the cell.\nTelophase II and Cytokinesis The single chromosomes arrive at \nopposite ends of the cell. Nuclear membranes re-form, a cleavage furrow \nforms, and the cytoplasm in both cells divides.\n These meiotic processes produce four daughter cells from the \noriginal single cell. These daughter cells are haploid, because they \ncontain 23 chromosomes only, not 23 pairs. Twenty-two of these are \nautosomes, and one is a sex chromosome.\n These daughter cells mature into secondary oocytes in the \novaries, and they mature into sperm in the testes. These processes are \ndescribed in more detail later in this chapter.",

         "1 A First Look at Anatomy\n1.4 Precise Language of Anatomy\n1.4e Body Cavities and Membranes\n----------\n\n\nInternal organs and organ systems are housed within separate en\nclosed spaces, or cavities. These body cavities are named according \nto the bones that surround them or the organs they contain. For \npurposes of discussion, the axial region is subdivided into two areas: \nthe posterior aspect and the ventral cavity.\n Posterior Aspect\n The posterior aspect has two enclosed cavities (figure 1.9a). \nA  cranial cavity is formed by the cranium, and so it also goes by the \nname endocranium. It houses the brain. A vertebral (ver′te-brăl) \ncanal is formed by the individual bones of the vertebral column \nand contains the spinal cord. These two cavities are encased in \nbone and thus are physically and developmentally different from the \nventral cavity. The term dorsal body cavity has been used by others \nto describe this posterior aspect, but is not used here because of these \ndifferences between the posterior aspect and the ventral cavity.\n\n Ventral Cavity\n The ventral cavity is the larger, anteriorly placed cavity in the body. \nThe ventral cavity is partitioned into a superior thoracic (thō-ras′ik) \ncavity and an inferior abdominopelvic (ab-dom′i-nō-pel′vik) cavity \nby the thoracic diaphragm (figure 1.9).\n Both the thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities are lined by  \nthin serous membranes, which are composed of two layers. A \n parietal (pă-rī′ĕ-tăl) layer typically lines the internal surface of the \n body wall, whereas a visceral (vis′er-ăl) layer covers the external \nsurface of organs  (viscera) within the cavity.  Between the parietal \nand visceral layers of the serous membrane is a potential space called \nthe serous cavity (a potential space is capable of becoming a larger \ncavity). Serous membranes secrete a liquid called serous fluid within \na serous cavity. Serous fluid has the consistency of oil and serves as \na lubricant. In a living human, the organs (e.g., heart, lungs, stomach, \nand intestines) move and rub against each other and the body wall. \nThis constant movement causes friction. The serous fluid’s lubricant \nproperties reduce this friction and help the organs move smoothly \nagainst both one another and the body wall\n\nFigure 1.10a provides a helpful analogy for visualizing the \nserous membrane layers. The closed fist is comparable to an organ, \nand the balloon is comparable to a serous membrane. When a fist \nis pushed into the wall of the balloon, the inner balloon wall that \nsurrounds the fist is comparable to the visceral layer of the serous \nmembrane. The outer balloon wall is comparable to the parietal layer \nof the serous membrane. The thin, air-filled space within the balloon, \nbetween the two “walls,” is comparable to the serous cavity. The \norgan is not inside the serous cavity; it is actually outside this cavity \nand merely covered by the visceral layer of the serous membrane!\n\n\n Thoracic Cavity \n The median space in the thoracic cavity is called the \nmediastinum (me′dē-as-tī′nŭm) (see figure 1.9b). It contains the heart, \nthymus, esophagus, trachea, and major blood vessels.\n Within the mediastinum, the heart is enclosed by a two-layered \nserous membrane called the pericardium (see figure 1.10b). The \nparietal pericardium (per-i-kar′dē-ŭm; peri = around, kardia = \nheart) is the outermost layer and forms the sac around the heart; the \nvisceral pericardium (also called epicardium; epi = upon) forms \nthe heart’s external surface. The pericardial cavity is the potential \nspace between the parietal and visceral pericardia; it contains serous \nfluid (see section 22.1c).\n The right and left sides of the thoracic cavity contain the lungs, \nwhich are lined by a two-layered serous membrane called the pleura \n(plūr′ă) (see figure 1.10c). The outer layer of this serous membrane is \nthe parietal pleura; it lines the internal surface of the thoracic wall. \nThe inner layer of this serous membrane is the visceral pleura; it \ncovers the external surface of the lung. The narrow, moist, potential \nspace between the parietal and visceral layers is called the pleural \ncavity, and it contains serous fluid (see section 25.4a)\n\nAbdominopelvic Cavity \n The abdominopelvic cavity consists of \nan abdominal cavity, which is superior to the pelvic brim of the hip \nbones (see section 8.3b), and a pelvic cavity that is inferior to the \npelvic brim. The abdominal cavity contains most of the organs of \nthe digestive system, as well as the kidneys and ureters of the urinary \nsystem. The organs of the pelvic cavity consist of the distal part of \nthe large intestine, the urinary bladder and urethra, and the internal \nreproductive organs.\n The peritoneum (per′i-tō-nē′ŭm; periteino = to stretch over) \nis a moist, two-layered serous membrane that lines the abdomi\nnopelvic cavity (see figure 1.10d). The parietal peritoneum, the \nouter layer of this serous membrane, lines the internal walls \nof the abdominopelvic cavity, whereas the visceral peritoneum, \nthe inner layer of this serous membrane, ensheathes the external \nsurfaces of most of the digestive organs. The potential space between \nthese serous membrane layers in the abdominopelvic cavity is the \nperitoneal cavity, where the lubricating serous fluid is located (see \nsection 26.4a). \n\n\n### Table 1.4 Body Cavities\n\n| Cavity Aspect / Name        | Description                                                                 | Serous Membrane |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Posterior Aspect Cavities** |                                                                             |                |\n| Cranial cavity              | Formed by the cranium; houses the brain                                     | None           |\n| Vertebral canal             | Formed by the vertebral column; contains the spinal cord                    | None           |\n| **Ventral Cavities**         |                                                                             |                |\n| **THORACIC CAVITY**         | Chest cavity; bordered anteriorly and laterally by chest wall and inferiorly by diaphragm | None           |\n| Mediastinum                 | Contains the pericardial cavity, heart, thymus, trachea, esophagus, and major blood vessels | None           |\n| Pericardial                 | Central region associated with the heart                                     | Pericardium    |\n| Pleural                     | Lateral regions associated with the lungs                                    | Pleura         |\n| **ABDOMINOPELVIC CAVITY**    | Composed of two parts: abdominal and pelvic cavities                        | None           |\n| Abdominal                   | Bordered superiorly by diaphragm and inferiorly by the pelvic brim of the hip bones; associated with abdominal viscera, including stomach, spleen, liver, pancreas, small intestine, most of large intestine, kidneys, ureters | Peritoneum     |\n| Pelvic                      | Region located inferior to the pelvic brim of the hip bones; associated with pelvic viscera, including urinary bladder and urethra, internal reproductive organs, some of the large intestine | Peritoneum     |\n",

         "3 Embryology\n3.3 Pre-embryonic Period\n3.3a Fertilization\n----------\n\nFertilization is the process whereby two sex cells fuse to form a \nnew cell containing genetic material derived from both parents. \nBesides combining sperm and ovum genetic material, fertiliza\ntion restores the diploid number of chromosomes, determines the \ngenetic sex of the organism, and initiates cleavage (discussed later \nin this section). Fertilization occurs in the widest part of the uterine \ntube, called the ampulla. Following ovulation, the secondary oocyte \nremains viable in the female reproductive tract for no more than \n24 hours, whereas sperm remain viable for an average of 3 to 4 days \nafter ejaculation.\n Upon arrival in the female reproductive tract, sperm are not \nyet capable of fertilizing the secondary oocyte. Before they can suc\ncessfully do so, sperm must undergo capacitation (kă-pasʹ i-tāʹ shŭn; \ncapacitas = capable of), which is a period of physiological change dur\ning which the sperm attain the ability to fertilize a secondary oocyte. \nCapacitation takes place in the female reproductive tract, and typically \nlasts several hours. During this time, a glycoprotein coat and some \nproteins are removed from the sperm plasma membrane that overlies \nthe acrosomal region of the sperm. Capacitation allows the sperm to \nrespond to chemotropic (movement of cells in response to a chemical) \nsignals from the oocyte so it can locate the oocyte. It also gives the \nsperm an ability to gain hyperactive motility, interact with the oocyte \nzona pellucida, undergo acrosome reaction, and initiate oocyte plasma \nmembrane fusion. The acrosome (ak’ rō-sōm; akros = tip) is a mem\nbranous cap at the head of the sperm containing digestive enzymes \nthat can break down the protective layers around the secondary oocyte \n(figure 3.3a). These enzymes are released when the sperm comes into \ncontact with the secondary oocyte.\n Normally, millions of sperm are deposited in the vagina of \nthe female reproductive tract during intercourse. However, only a \nfew hundred reach the secondary oocyte in the uterine tube. Many \nsperm leak out of the vagina, and some are not completely motile \n(able to swim). Other sperm do not survive the acidic environment \nof the vagina, and still more lose direction as they move through the \nuterus and get churned by its muscular contractions. Recall that each \nmonth, only one of the two uterine tubes contains the secondary \noocyte. Sperm that travel into the uterine tube that does not contain \nthe secondary oocyte die. Thus, although millions of sperm may be \nreleased during sexual intercourse, only a few hundred have a chance \nat fertilization.\nOnce sperm reach the secondary oocyte, the race is on to see \nwhich sperm can fertilize the oocyte first. Only the first sperm to \nenter the secondary oocyte is able to fertilize it; the remaining sperm \nare prevented from penetrating the oocyte.\n\n Some causes of infertility (inability to achieve or maintain \npregnancy) are due to immune system reactions related to the \nsperm or oocyte. Some genetic males (and more rarely, some ge\nnetic females) develop anti-sperm antibodies, which are substances \n(specialized proteins) that mark and target the sperm for destruc\ntion by the immune system (see section 24.3a). It is believed that \nindividuals develop these antibodies against their sperm when the \nblood-testis barrier (a protective barrier between the testis and the  \nblood vessels traveling through it) is breached, such as due to \nsevere trauma to the testis or reversal of a vasectomy. In other \nimmune-related fertility problems, the woman’s body perceives the \nsperm and/or the fertilized oocyte as something foreign that must \nbe destroyed. Researchers are examining ways to prevent these \nimmune-related infertility problems from occurring.\n The phases of fertilization are corona radiata penetration, zona \npellucida penetration, and fusion of the sperm and oocyte plasma \nmembranes (figure 3.3b).\n Corona Radiata Penetration\n The sperm that successfully reach the secondary oocyte are initially \nprevented entry by both the corona radiata and the zona pellucida. \nWhen sperm reach the corona radiata, their motility allows the sperm \nto push through the cell layers. Once the sperm penetrate the corona \nradiata, they then encounter the more solid zona pellucida.\n Zona Pellucida Penetration\n Once the sperm make a pathway through the corona radiata, the \nsperm release digestive enzymes from their acrosomes to penetrate \nthe zona pellucida. This release of enzymes from the acrosome by \nexocytosis is known as the acrosome reaction. These enzymes \nare primarily hyaluronidase and acrosin and they eat away (digest)\na portion of the zona pellucida. After the first sperm successfully \npenetrates the zona pellucida and its nucleus enters the secondary \noocyte, immediate changes occur to both the zona pellucida and \nthe oocyte so that no other sperm can enter the oocyte. The corti\ncal reaction alters the zona pellucida by the exocytosis of oocyte \ncortical granules, leading to a modification of the zona pellucida to \nblock polyspermy. In essence, the zona pellucida hardens and sperm \nreceptors in the zona pellucida are deactivated preventing other \nsperm from binding to and ultimately digesting their way through \nthis layer. This process is necessary to ensure that only one sperm \nfertilizes the oocyte.\n On very rare occasions, two or more sperm nuclei simultane\nously enter the secondary oocyte, a phenomenon called polyspermy \n(polʹ ē-spĕrʹ mē; polys = many). Polyspermy is immediately fatal be\ncause it causes the fertilized oocyte to have 23 triplets (if two sperm \nenter) or 23 quadruplets (if three sperm enter) of chromosomes, \ninstead of the normal 23 pairs of chromosomes.\n\n Fusion of Sperm and Oocyte Plasma Membranes\n When the sperm and oocyte plasma membranes come into contact, \nthey immediately fuse. Only the nucleus of the sperm enters the cyto\nplasm of the secondary oocyte. Once the nucleus of the sperm enters \nthe secondary oocyte, the secondary oocyte completes the second \nmeiotic division and forms an ovum.\n\n Once meiosis is complete, the nucleus of the sperm and the \nnucleus of the ovum are called pronuclei (pro = before, precursor \nof) because they have a haploid number of chromosomes. These pro\nnuclei come together and fuse, forming a single nucleus that contains \na diploid number (23 pairs) of chromosomes. The single diploid cell \nformed is the zygote.",

Although an in\ndividual muscle fiber runs the length of a muscle, it takes groupings \nof many muscle fibers to form the width of a muscle. If you look at \na cross section (figure 10.1), each skeletal muscle is composed of \nfascicles (fas′i-kĕl; fascis = bundle), which are bundles of muscle \nfibers. Muscle fibers, in turn, contain cylindrical structures called \nmyofibrils, which are composed of myofilaments. Table 10.1 illus\ntrates the levels of organization in a skeletal muscle.\nConnective Tissue Components\n Three layers of connective tissue occur within muscle: endomysium, \nperimysium, and epimysium. These layers, composed of collagen and \nelastic fibers, provide protection, sites for distribution of blood vessels \nand nerves, and a means of attachment to the skeleton. \nThe endomysium (en′dō-mis′ē-ŭm, -miz′ē-ŭm; endon = within,  \nmys = muscle) is the innermost connective tissue layer. It is a \ndelicate, areolar connective tissue layer that surrounds and electri\ncally insulates each muscle fiber. It contains reticular fibers to help \nbind together neighboring muscle fibers and support capillaries near \nthese fibers.\n The perimysium (per′i-mis′ē-ŭm, -miz′ē-ŭm; peri = around) \nsurrounds the fascicles. The dense irregular connective tissue sheath \nof the perimysium contains extensive arrays of blood vessels and \nnerves (called neurovascular bundles) that branch to supply each \nindividual fascicle.\n The epimysium (ep′i-mis′ē-ŭm; epi = upon) is a layer of dense \nirregular connective tissue that surrounds the whole skeletal muscle.\n Deep fascia (fash′ē-ă; band or filler), (also called visceral or \nmuscular fascia), is an additional expansive sheet of dense irregu\nlar connective tissue that lies external to the epimysium, but often \nblends with it. It separates individual muscles, binds together mus\ncles with similar functions, forms sheaths to help distribute nerves, \nblood vessels, and lymphatic vessels, and fills spaces between \nmuscles. The deep fascia is internal to a layer called the superficial \nfascia (also called the subcutaneous layer). The superficial fascia \nis composed of areolar and adipose connective tissue that separates \nmuscle from skin.\nMuscle Attachments At the ends of a muscle, the connective \ntissue layers merge to form a fibrous tendon, which attaches the \nmuscle to bone, skin, or another muscle. Tendons usually have a \nthick, cordlike structure. Sometimes, the tendon forms a thin, flat\ntened sheet, termed an aponeurosis (ap′ō-nū-rō′sis; apo = from, \nneuron = sinew).\n Most skeletal muscles extend between bones and cross at \nleast one mobile joint. Upon contraction, one of the bones moves \nwhile the other bone usually remains fixed. Often the less mobile \nattachment is called the origin and the more mobile attachment is \ncalled the insertion. The origin and insertion of muscles are not \nalways easily determined by either movement or position, and some \nanatomists and clinicians are no longer using this terminology. Thus, \nwe typically will use the terms superior attachment and inferior \nattachment when referring to the muscles moving the axial skeleton, \nand proximal attachment and distal attachment when referring to \nthe muscles moving the appendicular skeleton. In muscles moving the \naxial skeleton, the superior attachment is often more mobile than the \ninferior attachment; thus, the superior portion of the body is pulled \ntoward the inferior portion when the muscles contract as in flexing \nyour neck or doing a crunch. In muscles moving the appendicular \nskeleton, the distal attachment is more mobile than the proximal attachment, \nand when muscles contract, the distal attachment moves \ntoward the proximal attachment, as shown in figure 10.2. The biceps \nbrachii muscle’s proximal attachment is the scapula, and the distal \nattachment is the radius. As the biceps brachii contracts, the radius \nis pulled toward the scapula, causing the arm to flex at the elbow.\nBlood Vessels and Nerves\n An extensive network of blood vessels and nerve fibers extends \nthrough both the epimysium and the perimysium of skeletal muscle. \nThe blood vessels deliver to the muscle fibers nutrients and oxygen \nneeded for the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). They also \nremove waste products produced by the muscle fibers.\n Skeletal muscles are classified as voluntary muscles because \nthey are controlled by the somatic (voluntary) nervous system and \nwe can consciously move our skeletal muscles. Somatic motor \nneurons extend from the brain and spinal cord to innervate skeletal \nmuscle fibers. Each motor neuron has a long extension called an axon \n(ak′son; axis), or nerve fiber that branches extensively at its terminal \nend (see section 14.2a). The axon extends through all three connective \ntissue layers to almost make contact with an individual muscle fiber  \n(i.e., there is a very small gap of about 30 nanometers between the \nmotor neuron and muscle fiber). The junction between the axon and \nthe muscle fiber is called a neuromuscular junction, and will be dis\ncussed in section 10.3b\n\n###  Table 10.1 Organizational Levels of Skeletal Muscle\n| **Level** | **Description** | **Connective Tissue Covering** |\n|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Muscle** | Multiple fascicles housing many muscle fibers, connective tissue coverings, blood vessels, nerve fibers | **Epimysium** |\n| **Fascicle** | A bundle of muscle fibers | **Perimysium** |\n| **Muscle Fiber (muscle cell)** | Elongated, multinucleated, cylindrical fiber (cell); exhibits striations; contains myofibrils | **Endomysium** |\n| **Myofibril** | Long, cylindrical contractile element within muscle fiber; as long as the muscle fiber; composed of myofilaments; exhibits striations | None |\n| **Myofilaments** | Short contractile proteins of two types: **thick** (myosin) and **thin** (actin, tropomyosin, troponin) | None |\n",

         "9 Articulations\n9.4 Synovial Joints\n9.4a General Anatomy of Synovial Joints\n----------\n\nAll types of synovial joints have several basic, distinguishing fea\ntures: an articular capsule, a joint cavity, synovial fluid, articular \ncartilage, ligaments, and nerves and blood vessels (figure 9.4).\n Each synovial joint is composed of a double-layered capsule \ncalled the articular (ar-tik′yū-lăr) capsule (or joint capsule). The \nouter layer is called the fibrous layer, whereas the inner layer is a \nsynovial membrane (or synovium). The fibrous layer is formed from \ndense connective tissue, and it strengthens the joint to prevent the \nbones from being pulled apart. The synovial membrane is composed \nprimarily of areolar connective tissue, covers all the internal joint \nsurfaces not covered by cartilage, and lines the articular capsule.\n All articulating bone surfaces in a synovial joint are covered \nby a thin layer of hyaline cartilage called articular cartilage. This \ncartilage has numerous functions: It reduces friction in the joint dur\ning movement, acts as a spongy cushion to absorb compression placed \non the joint, and prevents damage to the articulating ends of the \nbones. This special hyaline cartilage lacks a perichondrium. Recall \nfrom section 4.2d that mature cartilage is avascular, so it does not \nhave blood vessels to bring nutrients to and remove waste products \nfrom the cartilage. Thus, if cartilage is damaged, its avascularity is \ncorrelated with lack of or delayed healing of the tissue. However, the \nrepetitious compression and expansion that occurs during exercise is \nvital to maintaining healthy articular cartilage because this action \nenhances its nutrition and waste removal.\n Only synovial joints house a joint cavity (or articular  cavity), \na space that contains a small amount of synovial fluid. The cavity \npermits separation of the articulating bones. The articular cartilage \nand synovial fluid within the joint cavity reduce friction as bones \nmove at a synovial joint.\n\n Lining the joint cavity is the synovial membrane, which se\ncretes a viscous, oily synovial fluid. Synovial fluid is composed of \nsecretions from synovial membrane cells and a filtrate from blood \nplasma. Synovial fluid has three functions:\n ■    Synovial fluid lubricates the articular cartilage on the \narticulating bones (in the same way that oil in a car engine \nlubricates the moving engine parts).\n ■ Synovial fluid nourishes the articular cartilage’s chondrocytes. \nThe relatively small volume of synovial fluid must be circulated \ncontinually to provide nutrients and remove wastes to these cells. \nWhenever movement occurs at a synovial joint, the combined \ncompression and re-expansion of the articular cartilage circulate \nthe synovial fluid into and out of the cartilage matrix.\n ■ Synovial fluid acts as a shock absorber, distributing stresses \nand force evenly across the articular surfaces when the pressure \nin the joint suddenly increases.\n\n Ligaments (lig′ă-ment; ligamentum = a band) are composed \nof dense regular connective tissue. Ligaments connect one bone \nto another bone and strengthen and reinforce most synovial joints.  \nExtrinsic ligaments are outside of and physically separate from the \narticular capsule, whereas intrinsic ligaments represent thickenings \nof the articular capsule itself. Intrinsic ligaments include extra\ncapsular ligaments on the outer surface of the articular capsule and \nintracapsular ligaments within the articular capsule.\n All synovial joints have numerous sensory nerves and blood \nvessels that innervate and supply the articular capsule and associated \nligaments. The sensory nerves detect painful stimuli in the joint and \nreport on the amount of movement and stretch in the joint. By moni\ntoring stretching at a joint, the nervous system can detect changes in \nour posture and adjust body movements. \nYou can predict which specific nerves innervate a joint by \nusing Hilton’s Law, which states the nerves innervating a joint typi\ncally also innervate the muscles that move the joint or the skin that \ncovers the joint. (You will learn these specific nerves when you get \nto sections 15.8 and 16.4.)\n In addition to the main structures just described, synovial joints \nusually have the following accessory structures: bursae, fat pads, and \ntendons.\n A bursa (ber′să; pl., bursae, ber′sē; a purse) is a fibrous, saclike \nstructure that contains synovial fluid and is lined by a synovial \n membrane (figure 9.5a). Bursae occur around most synovial joints and \nalso where bones, ligaments, muscles, skin, or tendons overlie each \nother and rub together. Bursae may be either connected to the joint \ncavity or completely separate from it. There are numerous bursae in the \nbody, and they are designed to alleviate the friction resulting from the \nvarious body movements, such as a tendon or ligament rubbing against \nbone. An elongated bursa called a tendon sheath wraps around tendons \nwhere there may be excessive friction. Tendon sheaths are especially \ncommon in the confined spaces of the wrist and ankle (figure 9.5b).\n Fat pads are often distributed along the margins of a synovial \njoint. They act as packing material and provide some protection for \nthe joint. Often fat pads fill the spaces that form when bones move \nand the joint cavity changes shape.\n Tendons (ten′dŏn; tendo = extend) are not part of the synovial \njoint itself. Like a ligament, a tendon is composed of dense regular con\nnective tissue. However, whereas a ligament binds bone to bone, a tendon \nattaches a muscle to a bone (see section 10.2b). When a muscle contracts, \nthe tendon from that muscle moves the bone to which it is attached, thus \ncreating movement at the joint. Tendons help stabilize joints because \nthey pass across or around a joint providing mechanical support, and can \nlimit the range or amount of movement permitted at a joint.\n\nFigure 9.5\n Bursae and Tendon Sheaths. Synovial-fluid-filled structures called bursae and tendon sheaths reduce friction where ligaments, muscles, tendons, and bones  \nrub together. (a) The knee joint contains a number of bursae. (b) The wrist and hand contain numerous tendon sheaths (blue).\n",

Explain how muscle names incorporate appearance, location, \nfunction, orientation, and/or unusual features.\n\nUsually, the names of skeletal muscles provide clues to their identifi\ncation. As figure 10.15 shows, skeletal muscles are named according \nto the following criteria:\n ■ Muscle action. Names that indicate the primary function \nor movement of the muscle include flexor, extensor, and \npronator. These are such common actions that the names \nalmost always contain other clues to the appearance or \nlocation of the muscle. For example, the pronator teres is a \nlong, round muscle responsible for pronating the forearm.\n ■ Specific body regions. The rectus femoris is on the thigh \n(femur), and the tibialis anterior is on the anterior surface of \nthe tibia. Muscles that can be seen at the body surface are\n often termed superficialis (sū′pĕr-fi′shē-ā′lis) or externus  \n(eks-ter′nŭs). In contrast, deeper or more internally placed \nmuscles may have names such as profundus (prō-fŭn′dŭs; \ndeep) or internus.\n ■ Muscle attachments. Many muscle names identify \ntheir prominent attachments. Often, the first part of the \nname is the inferior attachment and the second part of \nthe name is the superior attachment. For example, the \nsternocleidomastoid has inferior attachments on the sternum \nand clavicle (cleido) and a superior attachment on the \nmastoid process of the temporal bone.\n ■ Orientation of muscle fibers. The rectus abdominis muscle \nis named for its lengthwise-running muscle fibers; rectus \nmeans “straight.” Similarly, names such as oblique or obliquus \n(ob-l ī′kwŭs) indicate muscles with fibers extending at an \noblique angle to the longitudinal axis of the body.\n ■ Muscle shape and size. Examples of shape in muscle \nnames include deltoid, shaped like a triangle; orbicularis, \na circle; rhomboid, a rhombus; and trapezius, a trapezoid. \nShort muscles are called brevis (brev′is); long muscles are \ncalled longus (lon′gŭs) or longissimus (lon-jĭs′ĭ-mŭs; longest). \nTeres (ter′ēz, te′rēz) muscles are both long and round. Large \nmuscles are called magnus (mag′nŭs; big), major (mā′jo ̆r; \nbigger), or maximus (măk′sĭ-mŭs; biggest). Small muscles \nare called minor (mī′nŏr; smaller) or minimus (mĭ′nĭ-mŭs; \nsmallest).\n ■ Muscle heads/proximal tendons. Some muscles are named \nafter specific features—for example, how many proximal \ntendons or how many muscle bellies or heads each contains. A \nbiceps muscle has two heads/proximal tendons, a triceps muscle \nhas three heads/proximal tendons, and a quadriceps muscle has \nfour heads/proximal tendons.

         "5 Integumentary System\n5.1 Structure and Functions of the Integument\n5.1b Integument Functions\n----------\n\nThe integument is more than just a wrapping around the body. It \nserves many varied functions, including protection, prevention of \nwater loss and water gain, temperature regulation, metabolic regula\ntion, immune defense, sensory reception, and secretion.\n\nProtection\n The skin acts as a physical barrier that protects the entire body \nfrom physical injury, trauma, bumps, and scrapes. It also offers \nprotection against harmful chemicals, toxins, microbes, and \nexcessive heat or cold. Paradoxically, it can absorb certain chemi\ncals and drugs (such as estrogen from a birth control patch or nico\ntine from a nicotine patch). Thus, the skin is said to be selectively \npermeable because some materials are able to pass through it, \nwhile others are effectively blocked. The epidermis is built to \nwithstand stresses and regenerate itself continuously throughout a \nperson’s lifetime. The skin also protects deeper tissues from solar \nradiation, especially ultraviolet rays. When exposed to the sun, \nthe melanocytes become more active and produce more melanin, \nthus giving the skin a darker, tanned look. Even when you get a \nsunburn, the deeper tissues (muscles and internal organs) remain \nunaffected.\n Prevention of Water Loss and Water Gain\n The epidermis is water-resistant and helps prevent unnecessary \nwater loss or water gain. (If the skin were not water-resistant, each \ntime you took a bath you would swell up like a sponge as your skin \nabsorbed water!) Water cannot easily exit or enter the skin, unless it \nis specifically secreted by the sweat glands. The skin also prevents \nthe water within the body cells and in the extracellular fluid (the \nfluid outside of cells) from leaking out. When the skin is severely \nburned, a primary danger is dehydration, because the individual \nhas lost the protective skin barrier, and water can escape from body \ntissues.\n Although the integument is water-resistant, it is not entirely \nwaterproof. Some interstitial fluids slowly escape through the epi\ndermis to the surface, where they evaporate into the surrounding \nair, a process called transepidermal water loss (TEWL). About \n500 milliliters (mL) (about 1 pint) of water is lost daily by evapo\nration of moisture from the skin or from respiratory passageways \nduring breathing. There are two main types of transepidermal \nwater loss: insensible perspiration and sensible perspiration. \nInsensible perspiration is the release of water vapor from sweat \nglands under circumstances when we are not sweating. In contrast, \nsensible perspiration is visible  sweating. On most parts of the \nskin, water vapor released from sweat glands during insensible \nperspiration mixes with sebaceous secretions (sebum), which \nproduces a thin, slightly acidic film (pH 4–6) over the surface of \nthe epidermis. This film helps slow down TEWL by forming an \noily barrier over the surface of the skin. The acidic nature of the \nbarrier also prevents the invasion of certain bacteria.\n Temperature Regulation\n Body temperature is influenced by vast capillary networks and \nsweat glands in the dermis. When the body is too warm and needs \nto dissipate heat, the diameter of the blood vessels in the dermis \nenlarges to permit more blood flow through the dermis, and sweat \nglands release fluid onto the skin surface. As relatively more blood \nflows through these dermal vessels, the warmth from the blood \ndissipates through the skin, and the body cools off by evapora\ntion of the sweat. Conversely, when the body is cold and needs to \n conserve heat, the blood vessels in the dermis constrict to reduce \nblood flow. In an effort to conserve heat, more blood is shunted to \ndeeper body tissues, and relatively less blood flows in the dermal \nblood vessels.\n \n Metabolic Regulation\nVitamin D3, also called cholecalciferol (kō′lē-kal-sif′er-ol), is pro\nduced by some epidermal cells when they are exposed to ultraviolet ra\ndiation. Calcitriol (kal′si-trī′ol) is synthesized from the cholecalciferol \nby some endocrine cells in the kidney (see section 20.9a). Calcitriol is \nthe active form of vitamin D3 and is considered a hormone. It increases \nabsorption of calcium and phosphate from the small intestine into the \nblood, which results in a greater amount of the calcium being absorbed \nfrom the foods we eat. Thus, the synthesis of vitamin D3 is important \nin regulating the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood. As little \nas 15 minutes of direct sunlight a day may provide your body with its \ndaily vitamin D requirement.\n Immune Defense\n The epidermis contains a small population of immune cells. These \nimmune cells (derived from a type of white blood cell), called  \nepidermal dendritic (den-drit′ik) cells, or Langerhans cells, play \nan important role in initiating an immune response by phagocytiz\ning pathogens that have penetrated the epidermis and also against \nepidermal cancer cells.\n Sensory Reception\n The skin contains numerous sensory receptors. These receptors are \nassociated with nerve endings that detect heat, cold, touch, pressure, \ntexture, and vibration. For example, tactile cells (or Merkel cells) are \nlarge, specialized epithelial cells that stimulate specific sensory nerve \nendings when they are distorted by fine touch or pressure. Because \nyour skin is responsible for perceiving many stimuli, it needs differ\nent sensory receptor types to detect, distinguish, and interpret these \nstimuli. For further details about the other types of sensory receptors \nin the skin, see section 19.2.\n Secretion\n Skin exhibits an excretory function when it secretes substances from \nthe body during sweating. Sweating, or sensible perspiration, occurs \nwhen the body needs to cool itself off. Notice that sweat sometimes \nfeels gritty because of the waste products being secreted onto the skin \nsurface. These substances include water, salts, and urea, a nitrogen\ncontaining waste product of body cells. In addition, the skin contains \nsebaceous glands that secrete an oily material called sebum, which \nlubricates the skin surface and hair.\n",

         "6 Cartilage and Bone\n6.5 Maintaining Homeostasis and Promoting Bone Growth\n6.5d Fracture and Repair\n----------\n\n Bone has great mineral strength, and yet it may break as a result of \nunusual stress or a sudden impact. Breaks in bones, called fractures, \nare classified in several ways. They can be named from the cause: \nstress, trauma, or pathology. A stress fracture is a thin break caused \nby recent increased physical activity in which the bone experiences \nrepetitive loads (e.g., as seen in some runners). Stress fractures tend \nto occur in the weight-bearing bones (e.g., pelvis and lower limb). A \ntraumatic fracture is a result of impact or excess stress to the bone, \nand a pathologic fracture usually occurs in bone that has been \nweakened by disease, such as when the vertebrae fracture in someone \nwith osteoporosis (a bone condition discussed in Clinical View 6.6  \n“Osteoporosis” in section 6.7). Fractures are categorized by the \namount of soft tissue damage associated with the fracture. In a simple \nfracture, the broken bone does not penetrate the skin, whereas in a \n163\n compound fracture, one or both ends of the broken bone pierce the \noverlying skin and body tissues. Fractures are also known through \neponyms (such as Colles or Pott), which have specific characteristics \ndescribing these fractures. Most often fractures are classified by the \ndescription of the fracture. Figure 6.15 shows some of the different \nclassifications of fractures. Often many fracture classifications are \nused to describe a single fracture. For instance, a Colles fracture \nis a complete, transverse fracture of the distal radius with posterior \ndisplacement.\n The healing of a simple fracture takes about 2 to 3 months, \nwhereas a compound fracture takes longer to heal. Fractures \nheal much more quickly in young children (average healing time, \n3 weeks) and become slower to heal as we age. In the elderly, the \nnormal thinning and weakening of bone increases the incidence of \nfractures, and some severe fractures never heal without surgical \n intervention. Bone fracture repair can be described as a series of \nsteps (figure 6.16):\n 1. A fracture hematoma forms. A bone fracture tears blood \nvessels inside the bone and within the periosteum, causing \nbleeding, and then a fracture hematoma forms from the \nclotted blood.\n 2. A fibrocartilaginous (soft) callus forms. Regenerated blood \ncapillaries infiltrate the fracture hematoma due to an increase \nin osteoblasts in both the periosteum and the endosteum near \nthe fracture site. First, the fracture hematoma is reorganized \ninto an actively growing connective tissue called a procallus. \nFibro blasts within the procallus produce collagen fibers that \nhelp connect the broken ends of the bones. Chondroblasts in the \nnewly growing connective tissue form a dense regular connective \ntissue associated with the cartilage. Eventually, the procallus \nbecomes a fibrocartilaginous (soft) callus (kal′ŭs; hard skin). \nThe fibrocartilaginous callus stage lasts at least 3 weeks.\n 3. A hard (bony) callus forms. Within a week, osteoprogenitor \ncells in areas adjacent to the fibrocartilaginous callus become \nosteoblasts and produce trabeculae of primary bone. The \nfibrocartilaginous callus is then replaced by this bone, which \nforms a hard (bony) callus. The trabeculae of the hard callus \ncontinue to grow and thicken for several months.\n 4. The bone is remodeled. Remodeling is the final phase of \nfracture repair. The hard callus persists for at least 3 to  \n4 months as osteoclasts remove excess bony material from both \nexterior and interior surfaces. Compact bone replaces primary \nbone. The fracture usually leaves a slight thickening of the \nbone (as detected by x-ray); however, in many instances healing \noccurs with no obvious thickening.\n\nFigure 6.15\n Classification of Bone Fractures. \n| Fracture | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Avulsion | Complete severing of a body part (typically a toe or finger) |\n| Colles | Fracture of the distal end of the lateral forearm bone (radius); produces a \"dinner fork\" deformity |\n| Comminuted | Bone is splintered into several small pieces between the main parts |\n| Complete | Bone is broken into two or more pieces |\n| Compound (open) | Broken ends of the bone protrude through the skin |\n| Compression | Bone is squashed (may occur in a vertebra during a fall) |\n| Depressed | Broken part of the bone forms a concavity (as in skull fracture) |\n| Displaced | Fractured bone parts are out of anatomic alignment |\n| Epiphyseal | Epiphysis is separated from the diaphysis at the epiphyseal plate |\n| Greenstick | Partial fracture; one side of bone breaks—the other side is bent |\n| Hairline | Fine crack in which sections of bone remain aligned (common in skull) |\n| Impacted | One fragment of bone is firmly driven into the other |\n| Incomplete | Partial fracture extends only partway across the bone |\n| Linear | Fracture is parallel to the long axis of the bone |\n| Oblique | Diagonal fracture is at an angle |\n| Pathologic | Weakening of a bone caused by disease process (e.g., cancer) |\n| Pott | Fracture is at the distal ends of the tibia and fibula |\n| Simple (closed) | Bone does not break through the skin |\n| Spiral | Fracture spirals around axis of long bone; results from twisting stress |\n| Stress | Thin fractures due to repeated, stressful impact such as running (These fractures often are difficult to see on x-rays, and a bone scan may be necessary to accurately identify their presence.) |\n| Transverse | Fracture is at right angles to the long axis of the bone |",

         "4 Tissue Level of Organization\n4.1 Epithelial Tissue\n4.1c Specialized Structures of Epithelial Tissue\n----------\n\n\nBecause epithelial tissues are located at all free surfaces in the \nbody, they exhibit distinct structural specializations. An epithe\nlium rests on a layer of connective tissue and adheres firmly to it \nwhich secures the epithelium in place and prevents it from tearing. \nBetween the epithelium and the underlying connective tissue is a \nthin extracellular layer called the basement membrane. The base\nment membrane can be seen as a single layer beneath epithelium \nwith light microscopy (figure 4.1a). However, it actually consists of \nthree layers when examined using electron microscopy: the lamina \nlucida, the lamina densa, and the reticular lamina. The two laminae \nclosest to the epithelium contain collagen fibers as well as specific \nproteins and carbohydrates some of which are secreted by the epi\nthelial cells. Cells in the underlying connective tissue secrete the \nreticular lamina, which contains protein fibers and carbohydrates. \nTogether, these components of the basement membrane strengthen \nthe attachment and form a selective molecular barrier between the \nepithelium and the underlying connective tissue. \nThe basement membrane has the following functions:\n ■ Provides physical support for the epithelium\n ■ Anchors the epithelium to the connective tissue\n ■ Acts as a barrier to regulate the movement of large  \nmolecules between the epithelium and the underlying \nconnective tissue\n Intercellular Junctions\n Epithelial cells are strongly bound together by specialized connections \nin the plasma membranes of their lateral surfaces called intercellular \njunctions. There are four types of junctions: tight junctions, adhering \njunctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions (figure 4.1b). Each of these \ntypes of junctions has a specialized structure.\n Tight Junctions Tight junctions, also called zonula (zō′nyū-lă) \noccludens (“occluding belt”), encircle epithelial cells near their apical \nsurface and completely attach each cell to its neighbors. Plasma mem\nbrane proteins among neighboring cells fuse, so the apical surfaces of \nthe cells are tightly connected everywhere around the cell. This seals off \nthe intercellular space and prevents substances from passing between the \nepithelial cells. The tight junction forces almost all materials to move \nthrough, rather than between, the epithelial cells in order to cross the \nepithelium. Thus, epithelia control whatever enters and leaves the body. \nFor example, in the small intestine, tight junctions prevent digestive \nenzymes that degrade molecules from moving between epithelial cells \ninto underlying connective tissue.\n Adhering Junctions Adhering junctions, also called zonula \nadherens (“adhesion belt”), form completely around the cell. This \ntype of junction occurs when extensive zones of microfilaments \nextend from the cytoplasm into the plasma membrane, forming a \nsupporting and strengthening belt within the plasma membrane \nthat completely encircles the cell immediately adjacent to all of its \nneighbors. Typically, adhering junctions are located deep to the tight \njunctions; the anchoring of the microfilament proteins within this belt \nprovides the only means of junctional support for the apical surface \nof the cell. The ultra-strong tight junctions are needed only near the \napical surface and not along the entire length of the cell. Once neigh\nboring cells are fused together by the tight junctions near the apical \nsurface, the adhering junctions support the apical surface and provide \nfor a small space between neighboring cells in the direction of the \nbasal surface. Thus, the junction affords a passageway between cells \nfor materials that have already passed through the apical surface of the \nepithelial cell and can then exit through the membranes on the lateral \nsurface and continue their journey toward the basement membrane.\n Desmosomes A desmosome (dez′mō-sōm; desmos = a band, soma =  \nbody), also called a macula adherens (“adhering spot”), is like a button \nor snap between adjacent epithelial cells. Each cell contributes half of \nthe complete desmosome. It is a small region that holds cells together \nand provides resistance to mechanical stress at a single point, but it does \nnot totally encircle the cell. In contrast to tight junctions, which encircle \nthe cell to secure it to its neighbors everywhere around its periphery, \nthe desmosome attaches a cell to its neighbors only at potential stress \npoints. The neighboring cells are separated by a small space that is \nspanned by a fine web of protein filaments. These filaments anchor \ninto a thickened protein plaque located at the internal surface of the \nplasma membrane. On the cytoplasmic side of each plaque, intermediate \nfilaments of the cytoskeleton penetrate the plaque to extend through\nout the cell the support and strength  supplied between the cells by the \ndesmosome. The basal cells of some epithelial tissue exhibit structures \ncalled hemidesmosomes, half-desmosomes that anchor them to the \nunderlying basement membrane.\n Gap Junctions A gap junction is formed across the intercellular gap \nbetween neighboring cells. This gap (about 2 nanometers in length) is \nbridged by structures called connexons (kŏ-neks′ŏnz). Each connexon \nconsists of six transmembrane proteins, arranged in a circular fashion to \nform a tiny, fluid-filled tunnel or pore. Gap junctions provide a direct \npassageway for small molecules traveling between neighboring cells. \nIons, glucose, amino acids, and other small solutes can pass directly \nfrom the cytoplasm of one cell into the neighboring cell through these \nchannels. The flow of ions between cells coordinates such cellular \nactivities as the beating of cilia. Gap junctions are also seen in certain \ntypes of muscle tissue, where they help coordinate contraction activities.",

         "1 A First Look at Anatomy\n1.1 History of Human Anatomy\n----------\n ✓Learning Objectives\n 1. Explain the contributions of early scientists to the field of \nhuman anatomy.\n 2. Describe the significant technological developments that helped \nexpand the study of human body structures and pass on that \nknowledge\n\nFor several centuries bce., the main centers of the scientific world \nwere in ancient Greece and Egypt. Around 400 bce., the Greek physi\ncian Hippocrates developed a medical practice based upon observa\ntions and studies of the human body. Hippocrates tried to accurately \ndescribe disease symptoms and thought that a physician should treat \nthe body as a whole rather than as a collection of individual parts. \nHippocrates is called the “Father of Medicine.”\n The ancient Egyptians had developed specialized knowledge \nin some areas of human anatomy, which they applied to efforts to \nmummify their deceased leaders. In Alexandria, Egypt, one of the \ngreat anatomy teachers in 300 bce was Herophilus, a Greek scientist \nwho was the first to publicly dissect human and animal bodies. Many \nof the early descriptions of anatomic structures were a result of his \nefforts. He is known as the “Father of Anatomy” because he based \nhis conclusions (such as that blood vessels carry blood) upon human \ndissection. The work of Herophilus greatly influenced Galen of \nPergamum, who lived between 130 and 200 ce (ad) and was dubbed \nthe “Prince of Physicians” because he stressed the importance of \nexperimentation in medicine. Galen wrote many treatises, including \nOn the movement of the chest and of the lung, On anatomical proce\ndure, and On the uses of the parts of the body of man.\n\n Advancements in anatomy were curtailed for almost a thousand \nyears from 200 to 1200 ce. Western Europeans had lost the anatomic \ntreatises attributed to Galen. However, these works had been trans\nlated into Arabic by Islamic scholars. After 1200 ce, Galen’s treatises \nbegan to be translated from Arabic into Latin. In the mid-1200s, \nthe first European medical school was established in Salerno, Italy. \nThere, human bodies were dissected in public. Importantly, in the \nmid-1400s, movable type and copperplate engraving were invented, \nthus providing a means for disseminating anatomic information on a \nlarger scale. Just before 1500 ce, in Padua, Italy, an anatomic theater \nopened and became the centerpiece for the study of human anatomy.\n Illustrations became a way of recording anatomic findings and \npassing on that knowledge (figure 1.1). Leonardo da Vinci began his \nstudy of the human body around 1500 ce. Da Vinci became fascinated \nwith the human body when he performed dissections to improve his\ndrawing and painting techniques. In the mid-1500s, Andreas Vesa\nlius, a Belgian physician and anatomist, began a movement in medi\ncine and anatomy that was characterized by “refined observations.” \nHe organized the medical school classroom in a way that brought \nstudents close to the operating table. His dissections of the human \nbody and descriptions of his findings helped correct misconceptions \nthat had existed for 2000 years. Vesalius was called the “Reformer \nof Anatomy” because he promoted the idea of “living anatomy.” His \ntext, De Humani Corporis Fabrica, was the first anatomically ac\ncurate medical textbook, and the fine engravings in the book were \nproduced from his personal sketches.\n William Harvey was an Englishman who studied medicine at the \nUniversity of Padua in Italy in the early 1600s, a time when this was the \ncenter for western European medical instruction. In 1628 he published \na book, entitled An Anatomical Study of the Motion of the Heart and \nof the Blood in Animals, that described how blood was pumped from \nthe heart to the body and then back to the heart. His ideas on recircula\ntion formed the basis for modern efforts to study the heart and blood \nvessels. In a second publication, Essays on the Generation of Animals, \nHarvey established the basis for modern embryology.\n A new art form for anatomy, called the preserved specimen, \nappeared in the late 1600s when anatomists began to collect bodies \nand body parts. Because these were real specimens, viewers of the \nexhibits containing these specimens were astonished.\n In the 1700s, the quality of anatomic illustrations improved \ndramatically with the simultaneous development of etching and \nengraving techniques along with mezzotint that provided beauty and \ntexture. By the late 1700s to early 1800s, anatomists began to ensure \nthat scientific illustrations were as accurate and realistic as possible \nby removing imaginative visual elements from artistic efforts.\n Anatomists discovered in the early 1800s that cross sections \nobtained from frozen cadavers and parts of cadavers provided incredible \ninsight into the complexity of the human body. The nature of the frozen \nspecimens improved in the 1900s with advancements in this field, which \ncame to be called cryotechnology. In the late 1980s, the Visible Human \nProject began. Two donated bodies were deep-frozen in blue gelatin, \nand then cut into extremely thin cross sections from head to toe. Each \nnewly exposed layer was photographed digitally for computer analysis.\n More recently, anatomists have been using a technique called \nplastination, a unique technology that preserves anatomic specimens \nusing reactive polymers. Plastination may preserve individual organs \nor may preserve entire bodies for observation and study.\n WHAT DID YOU LEARN?\n ● 1 What research method that is still used today formed the basis \nof our earliest knowledge about human body structure?\n ● 2 How did the invention of movable type and engraving \ntechniques contribute to the science of human anatomy?\n\n\n",

         "9 Articulations\n9.5 Selected Articulations in Depth\n9.5a Joints of the Axial Skeleton\n----------\n\nTemporomandibular Joint\n The temporomandibular (tem′pŏ-rō-man-dib′yū-lăr) joint (TMJ) \nis formed by the articulation of the head of the mandible with the \narticular tubercle of the temporal bone anteriorly and the mandibular \nfossa posteriorly. This small, complex articulation is the only mo\nbile joint between skull bones. The temporomandibular joint has \nseveral unique anatomic features (figure 9.12). A loose articular \ncapsule surrounds the joint and promotes an extensive range of mo\ntion. The TMJ is poorly stabilized, and thus a forceful anterior or \nlateral movement of the mandible can result in partial or complete \ndislocation of the mandible. The joint contains an articular disc, \nwhich is a thick pad of fibrocartilage separating the articulating \nbones and extending horizontally to divide the joint cavity into \ntwo separate chambers. As a result, the temporomandibular joint \nis really two synovial joints—one between the temporal bone and \nthe articular disc, and a second between the articular disc and the  \nmandible.\n Several ligaments support this joint. The sphenomandibular  \nligament (an extracapsular ligament) is a thin band that extends \nanteriorly and inferiorly from the sphenoid to the medial surface \nof the mandibular ramus. The stylomandibular ligament (an \nextracapsular ligament) is a thick band that extends from the sty\nloid process of the temporal bone to the mandibular angle. The  \ntemporomandibular ligament (or lateral ligament) is located \non the lateral portion of the articular capsule. This ligament ex\ntends inferiorly and posteriorly from the articular tubercle to the \nmandible.\n The temporomandibular joint allows for hinge, gliding, and \nsome pivot joint movements of the mandible. It functions like a hinge \nduring mandible depression and elevation while chewing. It glides \nslightly forward during protraction of the mandible for biting, and \nglides slightly from side-to-side to grind food between the teeth dur\ning chewing.  \nIntervertebral Articulations\n Intervertebral articulations are located between the bodies of \nadjacent vertebrae, as well as between the superior and inferior \narticular processes of adjacent vertebrae (see section 7.4c). All of \nthe vertebral bodies, between the axis (C2) and the sacrum, are \nseparated and cushioned by pads of fibrocartilage called inter\nvertebral discs (figure 9.13). Each intervertebral disc consists of \ntwo components: (1) an anulus fibrosus and (2) a nucleus pulposus. \nThe anulus fibrosus is the tough outer layer of fibrocartilage \nthat covers each intervertebral disc. The anulus fibrosus contains \ncollagen fibers that attach the disc to the bodies of adjacent ver\ntebrae. The anulus fibrosus also shares connections with many \nof the ligaments that run along the bodies of the vertebrae. The \nnucleus pulposus is the inner gelatinous core of the disc and is \nprimarily composed of water, with some scattered reticular and \nelastic fibers.\n Two factors compress the substance of the nucleus pulposus \nand displace it in every direction—movement of the vertebral col\numn and the weight of the body. However, as humans age, water is \ngradually lost from the nucleus pulposus within each disc. Thus, \nover time the discs become less effective as a cushion, and the \nchances for vertebral injury increase. Loss of water by the discs \nalso contributes to the shortening of the vertebral column, which \naccounts for the characteristic decrease in height that occurs with \nadvanced age.\n Several ligaments stabilize the vertebral column by support\ning vertebrae through attachments either to their bodies or their \nprocesses. The anterior longitudinal ligament is a thick, sturdy \nligament that attaches vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs at \ntheir anterior surfaces. The posterior longitudinal ligament at\ntaches the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies and discs. It is \nmuch thinner than the anterior longitudinal ligament, and it runs \nwithin the vertebral canal. Multiple interspinous ligaments inter\nconnect the spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae. Their angled \nfibers merge with the supraspinous ligament. The supraspinous \nligament interconnects the tips of the spinous processes from C7 to \nthe sacrum. The ligamentum (lig′ă-men′tŭm) nuchae (nū′kē; back of \nneck) is the part of the supraspinous ligament that extends between \nC7 and the base of the skull. The ligamentum nuchae is very thick \nand sturdy, and helps stabilize the skull on the cervical vertebrae. \nThe ligamentum flavum (flā′vŭm) connects the laminae of adjacent \nvertebrae.\n A second type of intervertebral articulation occurs at the \nsynovial joints between adjacent superior and inferior articular \nprocesses. The articular facets of the superior and inferior articular \nprocesses form plane joints that permit restricted gliding move\nments. An articular capsule surrounds these articular processes.\n The movement possible between a single set of vertebrae is \nlimited. However, when you add the movements of all the interverte\nbral joints of all the vertebrae together, an entire range of movements \nbecomes possible, including flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and \nsome rotation. \n",

Each os coxae is formed \nfrom three separate bones: the ilium, the ischium, and the pubis \n( figure 8.9). These three bones fuse between 13 and 15 years of age \nto form the single os coxae. Each os coxae articulates posteriorly with \nan auricular surface of the sacrum at the sacroiliac joint. The femur \narticulates with a deep, curved depression on the lateral surface of the \nos coxae called the acetabulum (as-ĕ-tab′yū-lŭm; shallow vinegar \ncup). The acetabulum contains a smooth curved surface, called the \nlunate surface, which is C-shaped and articulates with the femoral \nhead. The three bones that form the os coxae (ilium, ischium, and \npubis) all contribute a portion to the acetabulum. Thus, the acetabu\nlum represents a region where these bones have fused.\n The largest of the three coxal bones is the ilium (il′ē-ŭm; \ngroin, flank), which forms the superior region of the os coxae and \nthe largest portion of the acetabular surface. The wide,  fan-shaped \nportion of the ilium is called the ala (ā′lă; wing). The ala  terminates \ninferiorly at a ridge called the arcuate line (ar′kyū-āt;  arcuatus = \nbowed) on the medial surface of the ilium. On the medial side of the \nala is a depression termed the iliac fossa. On the lateral surface of \nthe ilium, anterior, posterior, and inferior gluteal lines are attach\nment sites for the gluteal muscles of the buttock (see section 12.2a). \nThe posteromedial side of the ilium exhibits a large, roughened area \ncalled the auricular (aw-rik′yū-lăr; auris = ear)  surface, where the \nilium articulates with the sacrum at the  sacroiliac joint.\n The superiormost ridge of the ilium is the iliac crest. Palpate the \nposterosuperior edges of your hips; the ridge of bone you feel on each \nside is the iliac crest. The iliac crest arises anteriorly from a projection \ncalled the anterior superior iliac spine and extends posteriorly to \nthe posterior superior iliac spine. Located inferiorly to the ala of the \nilium are the anterior inferior iliac spine and the posterior inferior \niliac spine. The posterior inferior iliac spine is adjacent to a prominent \ngreater sciatic (sī-at′ik; sciaticus = hip joint) notch, through which the \nsciatic nerve travels to the lower limb (see section 16.4g).\n The ilium fuses with the ischium (is′kē-ŭm; ischion = hip) near \nthe superior and posterior margins of the acetabulum. The ischium \naccounts for the posterior two-fifths of the acetabular surface. Pos\nterior to the acetabulum, the prominent triangular ischial (is′kē-ăl) \nspine projects medially. The bulky bone superior to the ischial spine \nis called the ischial body. The lesser sciatic notch is a semicircular \ndepression inferior to the ischial spine. The posterolateral border of \nthe ischium is a roughened projection called the ischial tuberosity. \nThe ischial tuberosities are also called the sitz bones by some health \nprofessionals and fitness instructors, because they support the weight \n of the body when seated. If you palpate your buttocks while in a sit\nting position, you can feel the large ischial tuberosities. An elongated \nramus (rā′mŭs; pl., rami, rā′mī) of the ischium extends from the \nischial tuberosity toward its anterior fusion with the pubis.\n The pubis (pyū′bis) fuses with the ilium and ischium at the ac\netabulum. The ischial ramus fuses anteriorly with the inferior pubic \nramus to form the ischiopubic ramus (see figure 8.7). The superior \npubic ramus originates at the anterior margin of the acetabulum. \nThe obturator (ob′tū-rā′tŏr; obturo = to occlude) foramen is a space \nin the os coxae that is encircled by both pubic and ischial rami. A \nroughened ridge called the pubic crest is located on the anterosupe\nrior surface of the superior ramus, and it ends at the pubic tubercle. \nThe pubic tubercle is an attachment site for the inguinal ligament. \nA roughened area on the body of the pubis, called the symphysial  \n(sim-fiz′ē-ăl; growing together) surface, or pubic symphysis, denotes \nthe site of articulation between the pubic bones. On the medial sur\nface of the pubis, the pectineal (pek-tin′ē-ăl; ridged or relating to \nthe pubis) line originates and extends diagonally across the pubis to \nmerge with the arcuate line.",

Long bone development in \nthe limb is a good example of this process, which takes place in the \nfollowing steps (figure 6.11):\n 1. The fetal hyaline cartilage model develops. During the \neighth to twelfth week of development, chondroblasts secrete \ncartilage matrix, and a hyaline cartilage model forms. Within \nthis cartilage model are chondrocytes trapped within lacunae. \nA perichondrium surrounds the cartilage.\n 2. Cartilage calcifies, and a periosteal bone collar forms. \nWithin the center of the cartilage model (future diaphysis), \nchondrocytes start to hypertrophy (enlarge) and resorb (eat \naway) some of the surrounding cartilage matrix, producing \nlarger holes in the matrix. As these chondrocytes enlarge, \nthe cartilage matrix begins to calcify. Chondrocytes in \nthis region die and disintegrate because nutrients cannot \ndiffuse to them through this calcified matrix. The result is a \ncalcified cartilage shaft with large holes in the place where \nchondrocytes had been.\n As the cartilage in the shaft is calcifying, blood vessels \ngrow toward the cartilage and start to penetrate the \nperichondrium around the shaft. Stem cells within the \nperichondrium divide to form osteoblasts. As the osteoblasts \ndevelop, this supporting connective tissue becomes highly \nvascularized, and the perichondrium becomes a periosteum. \nThe osteoblasts within the internal layer of the periosteum \nstart secreting a layer of osteoid around the calcified cartilage \nshaft. The osteoid hardens and forms a periosteal bone collar \naround this shaft.\n 3. The primary ossification center forms in the diaphysis. \nA growth of capillaries and osteoblasts, called a periosteal bud, \nextends from the periosteum into the core of the cartilage shaft, \ninvading the spaces left by the chondrocytes. The remains of \nthe calcified cartilage serve as a template on which osteoblasts \nbegin to produce osteoid. This region is called the primary \nossification center because it is the first major center of \nbone formation. Bone development extends in both directions \ntoward the epiphyses from the primary ossification center. \nHealthy bone tissue quickly replaces the calcified, degenerating \ncartilage in the shaft. Most, but not all, primary ossification \ncenters have formed by the twelfth week of development.\n 4. Secondary ossification centers form in the epiphyses. The \nsame basic process that formed the primary ossification center \noccurs later in the epiphyses. Beginning around the time of \nbirth, the hyaline cartilage in the center of each epiphysis \ncalcifies and begins to degenerate. Epiphyseal blood vessels \nand osteoprogenitor cells enter each epiphysis. Secondary \nossification centers form as bone replaces calcified cartilage. \nNot all secondary ossification centers form at birth; some form \nlater in childhood. As the secondary ossification centers form, \nosteoclasts resorb some bone matrix within the diaphysis, \ncreating a hollow medullary cavity.\n 5. Bone replaces cartilage, except the articular cartilage \nand epiphyseal plates. By late stages of bone development, \nalmost all of the hyaline cartilage is replaced by bone. Hyaline \ncartilage is found only as articular cartilage on the articular \nsurface of each epiphysis, and as a region called the epiphyseal \n(ep′i-fiz′ē-ăl) plate, sandwiched between the diaphysis and the \nepiphysis.\n 6. Lengthwise growth continues until the epiphyseal plates \nossify and form epiphyseal lines. Bone growth continues \nthrough puberty until ossification of the epiphyseal plates, \nindicating the bone has reached its adult length. Eventually, the \nonly remnant of each epiphyseal plate is an internal thin line of \ncompact bone called an epiphyseal line. Depending upon the \nbone, most epiphyseal plates fuse between the ages of 10 and \n25. (The last epiphyseal plates to ossify are those of the clavicle \nin the late 20s.)\n\nTable 6.1 shows a minimum comparison between intramem\nbranous and endochondral bone formation. Although adult bone size \nhas been reached, the bone continues to reshape itself throughout a \nperson’s lifetime in a constant process of bone resorption and deposi\ntion called bone remodeling (discussed in section 6.4d).\n\n### Tableble 6.1 Comparison of Intramembranous and Endochondral\n| **Category**               | **Intramembranous Ossification**                               | **Endochondral Ossification**                                      |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Starting Tissue**         | Mesenchyme                                                       | Hyaline cartilage                                                     |\n| **Initial Development**     | 8 weeks                                                          | 8–12 weeks                                                            |\n| **Ossification Centers**    | Multiple                                                         | Diaphysis first, then epiphyses                                       |\n| **Examples of Bones**       | Flat bones of skull, some facial bones, mandible, and central clavicle | Upper and lower limb bones, pelvis, vertebrae, ends of clavicle, ribs |\n",

The contraction mechanism is \nsomewhat similar in all three, but they vary in their appearance, \nlocation, physiology, internal organization, and means of control by \nthe nervous system. Specific details about the muscular system are \ndiscussed in chapter 10.\n Skeletal Muscle Tissue\n Skeletal muscle tissue is composed of cylindrical muscle cells called \nskeletal muscle fibers (table 4.12a). Individual skeletal muscle cells are \nslender and often long (sometimes the length of the entire muscle). Such \nlong cells need more than one nucleus to control and carry out all cellular \nfunctions, so each skeletal muscle fiber is multinucleated; some contain \nhundreds of nuclei. These multiple nuclei form when smaller embryonic \nmuscle cells fuse early in the development of the skeletal muscle fiber. \nThe nuclei in skeletal muscle fibers are located at the edge of the cell \n(called the periphery), immediately internal to the plasma membrane.\n Skeletal muscle is described as striated and voluntary. When \nthis tissue is viewed with light microscopy, the cells of skeletal muscle \nexhibit alternating light and dark bands, termed striations (strī-ā′shŭn; \nstriatus = furrow), that reflect the overlapping pattern of parallel thick \nand thin contractile protein filaments inside the cell. Additionally, skel\netal muscle is considered voluntary because it usually does not contract \nunless stimulated by the somatic (voluntary) nervous system. Skeletal \nmuscle attaches to the bones of the skeleton and also forms muscles as\nsociated with the skin, such as the muscles of facial expression and those \nforming body sphincters that help control waste removal. When skeletal \nmuscles contract and relax, they produce heat for the body, which is why \nwe become warmer when we “work out” at the gym or fitness center.\n\nCardiac Muscle Tissue\nCardiac muscle tissue is confined to the thick middle layer of the \nheart wall (called the myocardium). Microscopically, cardiac muscle \ntissue resembles skeletal muscle in that both contain visible striations  \n(table 4.12b). However, several obvious cellular differences distinguish \nthe two types. First, the typical cardiac muscle cell is much shorter \nthan a typical skeletal muscle fiber. Second, a cardiac muscle cell \ncontains only one or two centrally located nuclei. Third, the cardiac \nmuscle cell often bifurcates (branches), thus resembling a Y in shape. \nFinally, cardiac muscle cells are connected by intercalated discs \n(in-ter′kă-lā-tĕd; intercalates = inserted between), which have strong \ndesmosomes and gap junctions between the cells. The intercalated \ndiscs promote the rapid transport of an electrical activity through many \ncardiac muscle cells at once, allowing the entire muscle wall to contract \nas a unit. When you view cardiac muscle tissue with light microscopy, \nthe intercalated discs appear as thick, dark lines between the cells.\n Cardiac muscle is responsible for the rhythmic heart contrac\ntions that pump blood throughout the blood vessels of the body. \nCardiac muscle cells are autorythmic because they do not require \nnervous system activity to initiate a contraction; instead, special\nized cardiac muscle cells in the heart wall initiate the contraction. \nCardiac muscle is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, so \nis considered involuntary. Thus, cardiac muscle tissue is striated, \nautorythmic, and involuntary. \nSmooth Muscle Tissue\n Smooth muscle tissue is so named because it lacks the striations \nseen in the other two types of muscle tissue, so the cells appear \nsmooth (table 4.12c). Smooth muscle tissue is also called visceral \nmuscle tissue because it is found in the walls of most viscera, such \nas the stomach, urinary bladder, and blood vessels. The contraction \nof smooth muscle helps propel and control the movement of material \nthrough these organs. Smooth muscle cells are fusiform (spindle\nshaped), which means they are thick in the middle and tapered at their \nends. The cells are also relatively short. Each cell has one centrally \nplaced nucleus. Smooth muscle is considered involuntary because it \nis innervated by the autonomic nervous system (see section 14.1b). We \ndo not have conscious control over it. For example, you cannot stop \nyour stomach from digesting your food or your blood vessels from \ntransporting your blood. \n\n\n### Table 4.12 Muscle Tissue\n| Feature   | (a) Skeletal Muscle Tissue | (b) Cardiac Muscle Tissue | (c) Smooth Muscle Tissue |\n|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Structure | Fibers are long, cylindrical, striated, parallel, and unbranched; fibers are multinucleated with nuclei along periphery | Cells are short, bifurcated, and striated, with one or two centrally located nuclei; intercalated discs between cells | Cells are fusiform (spindle-shaped), short, nonstriated, and contain one centrally located nucleus |\n| Function  | Moves skeleton; responsible for voluntary body movements, locomotion, heat production | Involuntary contraction and relaxation pump blood in heart | Involuntary movements and motion; moves materials through internal organs |\n| Location  | Attaches to bones or sometimes to skin (e.g., facial muscles); also found in the voluntary sphincters—lips, urethra, anus | Heart wall (myocardium) | Walls of hollow internal organs, such as vessels, airways, stomach, bladder, uterus |\n",

         "8 Appendicular Skeleton\n8.4 Lower Limb\n8.4d Tarsals, Metatarsals, and Phalanges\n----------\n\nThe bones that form the ankle and foot are the tarsals, metatarsals, \nand phalanges (figure 8.14). The seven tarsals (tar′săl; tarsus = flat \nsurface) of the ankle and proximal foot are analogous to the eight \ncarpal bones of the wrist, although their shapes and arrangement are \ndifferent. The tarsal bones are thoroughly integrated into the structure \nof the foot because they help the ankle bear the body’s weight.\n The calcaneus, talus, and navicular are considered the proximal \nrow of tarsal bones. The largest tarsal bone is the calcaneus (kal\nkā′nē-ŭs; heel), which forms the heel. Its posterior end is a rough, \nknob-shaped projection that is the point of attachment for the calcaneal \n(Achilles) tendon extending from the strong muscles on the posterior \nside of the leg. The superiormost and second-largest tarsal bone is the \ntalus (tā′lŭs; ankle bone). The superior aspect of the talus articulates \nwith the articular surface of the tibia. The navicular (nă-vik′yū-lăr; \nnavis = ship) bone is on the medial side of the ankle. \nThe distal row is formed by a group of four tarsal bones. The \nthree cuneiform (kū′ne-i-fōrm; cuneus = wedge) bones are wedge\nshaped bones with articulations between them, positioned anterior to \nthe navicular bone. They are named according to their position: medial \ncuneiform, intermediate cuneiform, and lateral cuneiform bones. \nThe cuneiform bones articulate proximally with the anterior surface \nof the navicular bone. The laterally placed cuboid (kyū′boyd; kybos = \ncube) bone articulates at its medial surface with the lateral cuneiform \nand the calcaneus. The distal surfaces of the cuboid bone and the cuneiform \nbones articulate with the metatarsal bones of the foot.\n\n WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n ● 5 What are some similarities and differences between the carpal \nbones and the tarsal bones?\n The metatarsal (met′ă-tar′săl) bones of the foot are five long \nbones similar in arrangement and name to the metacarpal bones \nof the hand. They form the sole of the foot and are identified with \nRoman numerals I–V, proceeding medially to laterally across the \nsole (figure 8.14). Metatarsals I through III articulate with the three \ncuneiform bones, and metatarsals IV and V articulate with the cuboid \nbone. Distally, each metatarsal bone articulates with a proximal pha\nlanx. At the head of the first metatarsal are two tiny sesamoid bones, \nwhich insert on the tendons of the flexor hallucis brevis muscle and \nhelp these tendons move more freely by distributing the force more \nevenly along them.\n The bones of the toes (like the bones of the fingers) are called \nphalanges. The toes contain 14 phalanges. The great toe is the hallux \n(hal′ŭks; hallex = great toe), and it has only two phalanges (proximal \nand distal); each of the other four toes has three phalanges (proximal, \nmiddle, and distal). \nArches of the Foot\n Normally, the sole of the foot is arched, which helps it support the \nweight of the body and ensures that the blood vessels and nerves on \nthe sole of the foot are not pinched when we are standing. The three \narches of the foot are the medial longitudinal, lateral longitudinal, \nand transverse arches (figure 8.15).\n The medial longitudinal arch (arcus = bow) is the highest \nof the three arches and extends from the heel to the great toe. It is \nformed from the calcaneus, talus, navicular, and cuneiform bones, \nand metatarsals I–III. The medial longitudinal arch prevents the me\ndial side of the foot from touching the ground and gives our footprint \nits characteristic shape (figure 8.15d).\n The lateral longitudinal arch is not as high as the medial arch, \nso the lateral part of the foot does contribute to a footprint. This arch \nextends between the little toe and the heel, and it is formed from the \ncalcaneus and cuboid bones, and metatarsals IV and V.\n The transverse arch runs perpendicular to the longitudinal \narches. It is formed by the distal row of tarsals (cuboid and cunei\nforms) and the bases of all five metatarsals. Note in figure 8.15c that \nthe transverse arch is higher medially than laterally due to the medial \nlongitudinal arch height.\n The shape of these arches is maintained primarily by the foot \nbones themselves. These bones are shaped so that they can interlock \nand support their weight in an arch, much like the wedge-shaped \nblocks of an arched bridge can support the bridge without other \nmechanical supports. Secondarily, strong ligaments attach to the \nbones and contracting muscles pull on the tendons, thereby helping \nto maintain the shape of the foot arches",

The first part \nof the name refers to the number of epithelial cell layers, and the \nsecond part describes the shape of the cells at the apical surface of \nthe epithelium.\n Classification by Number of Cell Layers\n Epithelia may be classified as either simple or stratified (figure 4.2a). \nA simple epithelium is one cell layer thick, and all of the epithelial \ncells are in direct contact with the basement membrane. A simple \nepithelium is found in areas where stress is minimal and where dif\nfusion, filtration, absorption, or secretion is the primary function. \nExamples of these locations include the internal linings of the air sacs \nin the lungs, intestines, and blood vessels.\n A stratified epithelium contains two or more layers of epi\nthelial cells. Only the cells in the deepest (basal) layer are in contact \nwith the basement membrane. A stratified epithelium resembles a \nbrick wall, where the bricks in contact with the ground represent the \nbasal layer and the bricks at the top of the wall represent the apical \n(superficial) layer. The multiple cell layers of a stratified epithelium \nmake it strong and capable of resisting stress and protecting underly\ning tissue. This epithelium is found in areas likely to be subjected \nto abrasive activities or mechanical stresses, as multiple layers of \ncells are better able to resist this wear and tear (e.g., skin, internal \nlining of the esophagus, pharynx, or vagina). Cells in the basal layer \ncontinuously regenerate as the cells in the apical layer are lost due to \nabrasion or stress.\n A pseudostratified (sū′do-strat′i-fīd; pseudes = false, stratum =  \nlayer) epithelium appears layered (stratified) because the cells’ nu\nclei are distributed at different levels between the apical and basal \nsurfaces. All of these epithelial cells are attached to the basement \nmembrane, but some of them do not reach its apical surface. Because \nall the cells are attached to the basement membrane, we have clas\nsified pseudostratified epithelium as a type of simple epithelium. A \nciliated pseudostratified epithelium lines the nasal cavity and the \nrespiratory passageways.\n Classification by Cell Shape\n Epithelia are also classified by the shape of the cell at the apical sur\nface. In a simple epithelium, all of the cells display the same shape. \nHowever, in a stratified epithelium a difference in shape can be seen \nbetween cells in the basal layer and those within the apical layer. \nFigure 4.2b shows the three common cell shapes seen in epithelia: \nsquamous, cuboidal, and columnar. (Note: All cells in this figure \nappear hexagonal when looking at their apical surface, or en face; \nthus these terms describe the cells’ shapes when viewed laterally, or \nfrom the side.)\n Squamous (skwā′mŭs; squamosus = scaly) cells are flat, wide, \nand somewhat irregular in shape. The nucleus looks like a flattened \ndisc. The cells are arranged like irregular, flattened floor tiles. \nCuboidal (kū-boy′dăl; kybos = cube, eidos = resemblance) cells \nare about as tall as they are wide. The cells do not resemble perfect \n“cubes,” because their edges are rounded. The cell nucleus is spheri\ncal and located within the center of the cell. Columnar (kō-lŭm′năr; \ncolumna = column) cells are slender and taller than they are wide. \nThe cells look like a group of hexagonal columns aligned next to each \nother. Each cell nucleus is oval and usually oriented lengthwise and \nlocated in the basal region of the cell.\n Another shape that occurs in epithelial cells is called \ntransitional (tran-si′shŭn-ăl; transitio = to go across). These cells \ncan readily change their shape or appearance depending upon how \nstretched the epithelium becomes. They occur where the epithelium \ncycles between distended and relaxed states, such as in the lining of \nthe bladder, which fills with urine and is later emptied. When the \ntransitional epithelium is in a relaxed state, the cells are described \nas polyhedral, which means “many-sided” and reflects the ranges in \nshape that are possible in this type of epithelium. When transitional \nepithelium is stretched, the surface cells resemble squamous cells.\n\n\nFigure 4.2\n Classification of Epithelia. \nTwo criteria are used to classify \nepithelia: the number of cell layers \nand the shape of the cell at the apical \nsurface. (a) An epithelium is simple \nif it is one cell layer thick, and \nstratified if it has two or more layers \nof cells. (b) Epithelial cell shapes \ninclude squamous (thin, flattened \ncells), cuboidal (cells about as tall as \nthey are wide), and columnar (cells \ntaller than they are wide).",

They have a single, centrally located nucleus. \nAlthough smooth muscle cells have both thick and thin filaments, \nthey are not precisely aligned, so no visible striations or sarcomeres \nare present. Z discs are absent from smooth muscle cells; instead, \nthin filaments are attached to dense bodies by elements of the cyto\nskeleton. Dense bodies are small concentrations of protein scattered \nthroughout the sarcoplasm and on the inner face of the sarcolemma. \nThe sarcoplasmic reticulum is sparse, and transverse tubules and \ntroponin are absent. Most of the calcium needed to activate smooth \nmuscle contraction originates in the interstitial fluid around the cell.\n The mechanism of smooth muscle contraction involves a calcium\nbinding protein called calmodulin. When the smooth muscle cells are in\nactive, no calcium enters from the interstitial fluid to bind to calmodulin; \nthus, smooth cells remain quiescent. However, when the cells are stimu\nlated, calcium ions enter from the interstitial fluid, and the calmodulin \nactivates a protein called myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK \nthen activates myosin ATPase, allowing crossbridge formation. \nSmooth muscle contraction is slow, resistant to fatigue, and usually \nsustained for an extended period of time. These are important character\nistics because smooth muscle in the walls of viscera and blood vessels \nmust sustain an extended contraction without undergoing fatigue. Smooth \nmuscle cells are resistant to fatigue because their ATP requirements are \nmarkedly reduced compared to the amount needed by skeletal muscle.\n Smooth muscle contraction is under involuntary control. For ex\nample, we cannot voluntarily contract the smooth muscle in the walls \nof our digestive organs. Thus, smooth muscle cells contract and our \nstomach seems to “growl” at an inappropriate time. As with cardiac \n muscle, the autonomic nervous system is one way that the contraction \nof smooth muscle is controlled.\n Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle are compared in table 10.6.\n\n\n###  Table 10.6 Muscle Tissue Types: General Comparisons\n| Muscle Tissue | Appearance and Shape of Cell | Location of Muscle Cell | Length / Cell Diameter | Autorhythmicity / Contraction Speed / Nervous System Control | Connective Tissue Components | Calcium Source / Junctions Between Cells / Neuromuscular Junctions | Presence of Myofibrils | Regeneration Capacity | Sarcomere Protein Organization | Sarcoplasmic Reticulum / Transverse Tubules |\n|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Skeletal Muscle | Long, cylindrical fiber; multiple peripheral nuclei internal to sarcolemma; striated | Attached to bones (usually via tendons) or to subcutaneous layer | Length: Long (100 μm–30 cm) Diameter: Large (10–100 μm) | Autorhythmicity: No Contraction speed: Fast Nervous system control: Voluntary | Three layers: Epimysium, perimysium, endomysium | Calcium source: Sarcoplasmic reticulum Junctions between fibers: No junctions Neuromuscular junctions: Individual, one per fiber | Extensive | Very limited; requires satellite cells | Highly organized; revealed by striations | Sarcoplasmic reticulum: Abundant Transverse tubules: Extensive; aligned with A- and I-band junctions |\n| Cardiac Muscle | Short, branched cell with 1 or 2 centrally located nuclei; intercalated discs between fibers; striated | Only in heart wall | Length: Short (50–100 μm) Diameter: Large (about 15 μm diameter) | Autorhythmicity: Yes Contraction speed: Moderate Nervous system control: Involuntary | One layer of endomysium only | Calcium source: Sarcoplasmic reticulum and interstitial fluid Junctions between cells: Intercalated discs contain gap junctions and desmosomes Neuromuscular junctions: None (cardiac conduction system is responsible for transmitting nerve impulses throughout the muscle) | Extensive, but of irregular thickness | Very limited or none¹ | Highly organized; revealed by striations | Sarcoplasmic reticulum: Moderate Transverse tubules: Extensive; aligned with Z disc |\n| Smooth Muscle | Spindle-shaped cell; a single centrally located nucleus; no striations | Found in walls of hollow organs (e.g., intestines, blood vessels); and in iris and ciliary body of eye | Length: Short (50–200 μm) Diameter: Small (5–10 μm) | Autorhythmicity: In some types only Contraction speed: Slow Nervous system control: Involuntary | One layer of endomysium only | Calcium source: Sarcoplasmic reticulum and interstitial fluid Junctions between cells: Gap junctions in some types only Neuromuscular junctions: In some types only | None | Extensive | None | Sarcoplasmic reticulum: Almost none Transverse tubules: None |\n",

         "2 The Cell: Basic Unit of Structure and Function\n2.6 Life Cycle of the Cell\n2.6b Mitotic (M) Phase\n----------\n\nCell division is necessary to provide the large number of cells essen\ntial for the growth and survival of a human. Cells divide at different \nrates through specific stages in their life cycle. Following interphase, \ncells enter the M (mitotic) phase (figure 2.20). Two distinct events \noccur during this phase: mitosis, or division of the nucleus, followed \nby cytokinesis (sī′tō-ki-nē′sis; kytos = cell, kinesis = movement), \ndivision of the cytoplasm.\n Mitotic cell division produces two daughter cells that are iden\ntical to the original (parent) cell. The nucleus divides such that the \nreplicated DNA molecules of the original parent cell are apportioned \ninto the two new daughter cells, with each receiving an identical copy \nof the DNA of the original cell.\n Four consecutive phases take place during mitosis: prophase, \nmetaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Each phase merges smoothly \ninto the next in a nonstop process. The duration of mitosis varies ac\ncording to cell type, but it typically lasts about 2 hours.\n\n Prophase\n Prophase is the first stage of mitosis (figure 2.20b). Chromatin be\ncomes supercoiled into relatively short, dense chromosomes, which \nare more maneuverable during cell division than the long, delicate \nchromatin strands. Remember that the DNA replicated itself during \ninterphase, so during prophase each chromosome (called a replicated \nchromosome or a double-stranded chromosome) contains two cop\nies of its DNA. A replicated chromosome consists of two genetically \nidentical structures, called sister chromatids. Each sister chromatid \nis composed of an identical DNA double helix, and the two sister \nchromatids are joined together by proteins at a constricted region \ncalled the centromere (sen′trō-mēr; kentron = center, meros = part).\n During prophase, the nucleolus breaks down and disappears. \nThe replicated chromosomes form a big puffy ball within the nucleus. \nElongated microtubules called spindle fibers begin to grow from the \ncentrioles, and this event pushes the two centriole pairs apart. Eventu\nally, the centrioles come to lie at opposite poles of the cell. The end of \nprophase is marked by the dissolution of the nuclear envelope, which \npermits the replicated chromosomes to move freely into and through \nthe cytoplasm.\n\n Metaphase\n Metaphase occurs when the replicated chromosomes line up along the \nequatorial plate of the cell (figure 2.20c). Spindle fibers grow from each \ncentriole toward the replicated chromosomes, and some attach to the \n centromere of each replicated chromosomes. The collection of spindle \nfibers extending from the centrioles to the replicated chromosomes \nforms an oval-structured array termed the mitotic spindle. This ar\nrangement remains in place until the next phase begins.\n\n Anaphase\n Anaphase begins as spindle fibers pull sister chromatids apart at the \ncentromere (figure 2.20d). The spindle fibers shorten, and each “reels in” \na chromatid, like a fishing line reeling in a fish. After the chromatids are \npulled apart, each chromatid is called a single  chromosome (or single- \nstranded chromosome), as each forms its own unique centromere. Thus, a  \npair of single chromosomes is pulled apart from sister chromatids, \nand each migrates to the opposite end of the cell (cell pole). As each \nsingle chromosome migrates toward the cell pole, its centromere leads \nthe way, and the arms of the chromosome trail behind. In most cases,  \ncytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, begins in late anaphase.\n\n Telophase\n Telophase begins once a group of single chromosomes arrives at each \ncell pole (figure 2.20e). A new nuclear envelope forms around each set \nof chromosomes, and the chromosomes begin to uncoil and return to \nthe form of dispersed threads of chromatin. The mitotic spindle breaks \nup and disappears. Each new nucleus forms nucleoli.\n Telophase signals the end of nuclear division and it overlaps \nwith cytokinesis. A contractile ring of protein filaments at the pe\nriphery of the cell equator pinches the mother cell into two separate \ncells. The resulting cleavage furrow indicates where the cytoplasm \nis dividing. The two new daughter cells then enter the interphase of \ntheir life cycle, and the process continues\n\n Use these to help you remember some of the hallmark events that occur \nduring each phase of mitosis:\n ■ The p in prophase stands for the puffy ball of replicated \nchromosomes that forms in the center of the cell.\n ■ The m in metaphase stands for middle: During this phase, the \nreplicated chromosomes align along the middle of the cell.\n ■ The a in anaphase stands for apart: During this phase, the sister \nchromatids are pulled apart.\n ■ The t in telophase stands for two: During this phase, two new cells \nbegin to form as a cleavage furrow divides the cytoplasm.",

         "2 The Cell: Basic Unit of Structure and Function\n2.3 Plasma Membrane\n2.3a Composition and Structure of Membranes\n----------\n\nA plasma membrane is not a rigid layer of molecules. Rather, a \ntypical plasma membrane is a fluid matrix composed of an approxi\nmately equal mixture, by weight, of lipids and proteins. In addition, \nthe plasma membrane has an external carbohydrate (sugar) coat, \ncalled the glycocalyx (glī′kō-kā′liks; glykys = sweet, kalyx = husk). \nThe following discussion explains how these components form the \nplasma membrane.\n Lipids\n Lipids are compounds that are insoluble in water; examples \nare fats, oils, and steroids. The insolubility of the lipids within \nthe plasma membrane ensures that the membrane will not “dis\nsolve” when it comes in contact with water. The three types of \nlipids in the plasma membrane are phospholipids, cholesterol, and \nglycolipids.\n Phospholipids Most of the plasma membrane lipids are \nphospholipids, which contain both water-soluble and water-insoluble  \nregions. Often these molecules are portrayed in the membrane as a \nballoon with two tails. The balloonlike “head” contains phosphate, \nwhich is charged (polar) and thus hydrophilic (“water-loving,” or \nattracted to water). The two “tails” are uncharged (nonpolar) and \nhydrophobic (“water-hating,” or repelled by water). When phospho\nlipid molecules are in water, the hydrophilic heads interact with the \nwater and the hydrophobic tails interact with each other, forming \ntwo parallel sheets. The tails form the internal environment of the \nmembrane, which is hydrophobic and keeps charged particles from \ncrossing the membrane. This basic structure of the plasma membrane \nis called the phospholipid bilayer (figure 2.4). It ensures that \nintracellular fluid (ICF) (fluid within the cell) remains inside the \ncell, and extracellular fluid (ECF) (fluid outside the cell) remains \noutside. One type of ECF is interstitial fluid, the thin layer of fluid \nthat bathes the external surface of a cell.\n Cholesterol Cholesterol, a type of lipid called a steroid, amounts \nto about 20% of the plasma membrane lipids. Cholesterol is scattered \nwithin the hydrophobic internal region of the phospholipid bilayer, \nwhere it strengthens the membrane and stabilizes it at temperature \nextremes. Cholesterol is primarily a nonpolar molecule but has a \npolar hydroxyl, which allows this molecule to associate with both \nthe phospholipid polar heads and the phospholipid nonpolar tails.\n Glycolipids Glycolipids, lipids with attached carbohydrate groups, \nform about 5% to 10% of the membrane lipids. They are located only \non the outer layer of the membrane, where they are exposed to the \nextracellular fluid. The carbohydrate portion of the glycolipid mol\necule is a component of the glycocalyx, which functions in cell–cell \nrecognition, intracellular adhesion, and  communication.\n Proteins\n The other common molecular structures within the plasma membrane \nare proteins. Proteins make up about half of the plasma membrane \nby weight. Proteins are complex, diverse molecules composed of \nchains of smaller molecules called amino acids. Proteins play various \nstructural and functional roles within the cell and within the body. \nResident proteins determine the specific functions of the plasma \nmembrane. Plasma membrane proteins are of two types: integral and \nperipheral.\n Integral proteins are embedded within, and can extend \nthrough the phospholipid bilayer. Some integral proteins act as mem\nbrane channels, providing a pore (hole) in the membrane through \nwhich specific substances pass. Other integral proteins, termed \nreceptors, serve as binding sites for molecules outside of the cell. \nHydrophobic regions within the integral proteins interact with the \nhydrophobic interior of the membrane. In contrast, the hydrophilic \nregions of the integral proteins are exposed to the aqueous environ\nments on either side of the membrane.\n Peripheral proteins are not embedded in the phospholipid \nbilayer. They are attached loosely either to the external or internal\nsurface of the membrane, often to integral proteins. Peripheral pro\nteins can “float” and move about the bilayer, much like a beach ball \nfloating on the surface in a swimming pool.\n Both integral and peripheral membrane proteins may serve as \nenzymes, which are also called catalysts. Enzymes are molecules \nthat are important for functional or metabolic activities in the cell \nbecause they change the rate of a reaction without being affected by \nthe reaction itself. \nMany integral membrane proteins are glycoproteins (proteins \nwith attached carbohydrate groups). They form about 90% of all the \nmembrane molecules that have carbohydrates attached to their exter\nnal surface. The carbohydrate groups attached to both glycoproteins \nand the previously mentioned glycolipids form the fuzzy glycocalyx \non the external surface of the plasma membrane.",

Movement of a bone at \na synovial joint is best described with respect to three intersecting \nperpendicular planes or axes:\n ■ A joint is said to be uniaxial (yū-nē-ak′sē-ăl; unus = one) if \nthe bone moves in just one plane or axis.\n ■ A joint is biaxial (bī-ak′sē-ăl; bi = double) if the bone moves \nin two planes or axes.\n ■ A joint is multiaxial (or triaxial [trī-ak′sē-ăl; tri = three]) if \nthe bone moves in multiple planes or axes.\n All synovial joints are diarthroses, although some are more \nmobile than others. From least mobile to most freely mobile, the \nsix specific types of synovial joints are plane joints, hinge joints, \npivot joints, condylar joints, saddle joints, and ball-and-socket joints \n(figure 9.6).\n A plane (planus = flat) joint, also called a planar or gliding \njoint, is the simplest synovial articulation and the least mobile type \nof diarthrosis. This type of synovial joint is considered a uniaxial \njoint because only side-to-side movements are possible. The articular \nsurfaces of the bones are flat, or planar. Examples of plane joints \ninclude the intercarpal and intertarsal joints (the joints between the \ncarpal bones and tarsal bones, respectively).\n A hinge joint is a uniaxial joint in which the convex surface of \none articulating bone fits into a concave depression on the other bone \nin the joint. Movement is confined to a single axis, like the hinge of a \ndoor. An example is the elbow joint. The trochlear notch of the ulna \nfits directly into the trochlea of the humerus, so the forearm can be \nmoved only anteriorly toward the arm or posteriorly away from the \narm. Other hinge joints occur in the knee and the finger (interpha\nlangeal [IP]) joints.\n A pivot (piv′ŏt) joint is a uniaxial joint in which one articulating \nbone with a rounded surface fits into a ring formed by a ligament and \nanother bone. The first bone rotates on its longitudinal axis relative to \nthe second bone. An example is the proximal radioulnar joint, where \nthe rounded head of the radius pivots along the ulna and permits the \nradius to rotate (see section 8.2b). Another example is the atlantoaxial \njoint between the first two cervical vertebrae. The rounded dens of the \naxis fits snugly against an articular facet on the anterior arch of the \natlas. This joint pivots when you shake your head “no.”\n Condylar (kon′di-lăr) joints, also called condyloid or \nellipsoid joints, are biaxial joints with an oval, convex surface on \none bone that articulates with a concave articular surface on the \nsecond bone. Biaxial joints can move in two axes, such as back\nand-forth and side-to-side. Examples of condylar joints are the \nmetacarpophalangeal (MP) (met′ă-kar′pō-fă-lan′jē-ăl) joints of \nfingers 2 through 5. The MP joints are commonly referred to as \nknuckles. Examine your hand and look at the movements along the \nMP joints; you can flex and extend the fingers at this joint (that is \none axis of movement). You also can move your fingers apart from \none another and move them closer together, which is the second \naxis of movement.\n A saddle joint is so named because the articular surfaces of the \nbones have convex and concave regions that resemble the shape of a \nsaddle. It allows a greater range of movement than either a condylar \nor hinge joint. The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb (between the \ntrapezium and the first metacarpal) is an example of a saddle joint. \nThis joint permits the thumb to move toward the other fingers so that \nwe can grasp objects.\n Ball-and-socket joints are multiaxial joints in which the \nspherical articulating head of one bone fits into the rounded, cuplike \nsocket of a second bone. Examples of these joints are the hip joint and \nthe glenohumeral joint. The multiaxial nature of these joints permits \nmovement in three axes. Move your arm at your shoulder, and see \nthe wide range of movements that can be produced. This is why the \nball-and-socket joint is considered the most freely mobile type of \nsynovial joint.\n",

         "8 Appendicular Skeleton\n8.2 Upper Limb\n8.2b Radius and Ulna\n----------\n\nThe radius and ulna are the bones of the forearm (figure 8.5). In \nanatomic position, these bones are parallel, and the radius (rā′dē-ŭs; \nspoke of a wheel, ray) is lateral. The proximal end of the radius has a \ndistinctive disc-shaped head that articulates with the capitulum of the \nhumerus. A narrow neck separates the radial head from the radial  \ntuberosity (or bicipital tuberosity). The radial tuberosity is an attach\nment site for the biceps brachii muscle.\n The shaft of the radius curves slightly and leads to a wide distal \nend where there is a laterally placed styloid (stī′loyd; stylos = pillar, \npost) process. This bony projection can be palpated on the lateral \nside of the wrist, just proximal to the thumb. On the distal medial \nsurface of the radius is an ulnar notch, where the medial surface \nof the radius articulates with the distal end of the ulna (figure 8.5c).\n The ulna (ŭl′nă) is the longer, medially placed bone of the \nforearm. At the proximal end of the ulna, a C-shaped trochlear notch \ninterlocks with the trochlea of the humerus. The posterosuperior \naspect of the trochlear notch has a prominent projection called the \nolecranon. The olecranon articulates with the olecranon fossa of the \nhumerus and forms the posterior “bump” of the elbow. (Palpate your \nposterior elbow; the bump you feel is the olecranon.) The inferior lip \nof the trochlear notch, called the coronoid process, articulates with \nthe humerus at the coronoid fossa. Lateral to the coronoid process, a \nsmooth, curved radial notch accommodates the head of the radius \nand helps form the proximal radioulnar joint (figure 8.5b). Also at the \nproximal end of this bone is the tuberosity of ulna. At the distal end \nof the ulna, the shaft narrows and terminates in a knoblike head that \nhas a posteromedial styloid process. The styloid process of the ulna \nmay be palpated on the medial (“little finger” side) of the wrist.\n Both the radius and the ulna exhibit interosseous borders, \nwhich face each other; the ulna’s interosseous border projects later\nally, whereas the radius’s interosseous border projects medially. These \ninterosseous borders are connected by an interosseous membrane \n(interosseous ligament), composed of dense regular connective tissue. \nThis membrane helps keep the radius and ulna a fixed distance apart \nfrom one another and provides a pivot of rotation for the forearm. The \nbony joints that move during this rotation are the proximal and distal \nradioulnar joints (figure 8.5b, c).\n In anatomic position, the palm of the hand is facing ante\nriorly, and the bones of the forearm are said to be in supination \n(sū′pi-nā′shŭn) (figure 8.5d). The radius and the ulna are parallel with \none another. If you stand in anatomic position, so that you can view your \nown forearm, the radius is on the lateral (thumb) side of the forearm, \nwhereas the ulna is on the medial (little finger) side of the  forearm.\n\nPronation (prō-nā′shŭn) of the forearm requires that the radius \ncross over the ulna and that both bones pivot along the interosseous \nmembrane (figure 8.5e). When the forearm is  pronated, the palm of \nthe hand is facing posteriorly. Now pronate your own forearm; you \ncan sometimes palpate the radius and feel it criss-crossing over the \nulna. In this position, the head of the radius is still along the lateral \nside of the elbow, but the distal end of the radius has crossed over and \nis the more medial structure.\n When an individual has the upper limbs extended and forearms \nsupinated, the bones of the forearm may angle laterally from the elbow \njoint. This positioning is referred to as the carrying angle of the elbow, \nand this angle measures about 5 to 15 degrees. The carrying angle posi\ntions the bones of the forearms such that the forearms will clear the hips \nduring walking (and as the forearm bones swing during the process). \nGenetic females typically have wider carrying angles than genetic \nmales, presumably because they have wider hips than males.

         "10 Muscle Tissue and Organization\n10.3 Contraction of Skeletal Muscle Fibers\n10.3c Physiology of Muscle Contraction\n----------\n\nThe arrival of a nerve impulse at the synaptic knob causes \nsynaptic vesicles to release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft \n(figure 10.9). ACh attaches to receptors in the motor end plate. \nThe binding of ACh causes the receptor to open, allowing sodium \n(Na+) ions to enter the muscle fiber, initiating an impulse (a rapid, \nlarge voltage change) across the sarcolemma of the muscle fiber. \nThis muscle impulse travels along the sarcolemma and into the \nmuscle fiber via the T-tubules. The muscle impulse continues to \nspread throughout the muscle fiber as long as ACh keeps the re\nceptors open. Usually ACh is quickly broken down and removed \nfrom the receptor by AChE.\n\nInteraction Between the T-tubules  \nand Terminal Cisternae\n Recall from section 10.2c that T-tubules distribute the muscle impulse \nthroughout the inside of the muscle fiber, and they are sandwiched \nby terminal cisternae, which are reservoirs storing the calcium ions \nrequired for muscle contraction. Spread of a muscle impulse along the \nT-tubule membrane causes calcium ions to leak out of the terminal \ncisternae into the sarcoplasm of the muscle fiber. These calcium ions \ndiffuse throughout the sarcoplasm and attach to the troponin of the \nthin filaments.\n Interactions Between Thick and Thin Filaments\n Contraction of a muscle fiber requires that the myosin heads in the \nthick filament bind to active sites on G-actin molecules of the thin \nfilaments (see figure 10.5). When the muscle fiber is in a relaxed state, \nthe tropomyosin molecules cover these active sites, preventing inter\naction between thick filaments and thin filaments. However, when a \ncalcium ion binds to troponin, the entire troponin molecule changes \nshape. As the troponin changes shape, it simultaneously moves the at\ntached tropomyosin molecule, exposing the active sites on the G-actin \nmolecules. Myosin is now able to bind to actin and form crossbridges.\n\nWhen the stimulation from the nerve impulse ceases, calcium ions \nare pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and are no longer \nattached to troponin. Troponin returns to its original shape, which \ncauses tropomyosin to once again block active sites on actin. Cross\nbridges can no longer form.\n The Mechanism of Sliding As crossbridges form, the myosin \nheads pivot toward the center of the sarcomere. This action pulls the \nthin filaments toward the sarcomere center, causing the Z discs to \nmove closer together as the sarcomere shortens. When the myosin \nhead finishes pivoting, the crossbridge detaches and returns to its \n original position (recocking), ready to repeat the cycle of “attach– \npivot–detach–return.”\n The mechanism of sliding is analogous to reeling in a fishing net \nor line with your hands. Imagine that your arms are the thick filament, \nthe rope for the net is the thin filament, the big “knots” in the rope are \nthe active sites, and your hands are the myosin heads. Your hands grab a \nknot in the rope (an “active site” on a G-actin), and you pull the net past \nyou (just as the head of a thick filament attaches onto the active site of \na thin filament and pulls the thin filament toward the center of the sar\ncomere). Then, your hands move alternately to the next knot in the rope, \nand you continue to pull the net into the boat. As you reel in the net, you \nare performing a series of “attach–pivot–detach–return.”\n Energy to drive this myosin movement is provided in the form \nof ATP. Myosin head attachment and pivoting do not require energy, \nbut ATP is needed for the myosin head crossbridge to detach from \nactin. Energy is released to power the detachment and recocking of \nthe myosin head when ATP binds to the myosin head and is broken \ndown into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and Pi (phosphate). The re\nturn of the fiber to its resting length is completely passive and results \nfrom the pull of antagonistic muscles and from elastic forces in the \ncontracting muscle fibers.",

         "1 A First Look at Anatomy\n1.3 Structural Organization of the Body\n----------\n\n✓Learning Objectives\n 7. \nRank the major levels of organization in the human body, from \nleast to most complex.\n 8. Describe the characteristics common to all forms of life.\n 9. List the 11 organ systems of the body and their major organs.\n\n\n Anatomists recognize several levels of increasingly complex organi\nzation in humans, as illustrated in figure 1.3. The chemical level is\nthe simplest level, and it involves atoms and molecules. Atoms are the \nsmallest units of matter. When two or more atoms combine, they form \na molecule. Examples of molecules include a sugar, a water molecule, \nor a vitamin. More complex molecules are called macromolecules \nand include some proteins and the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) \nmolecules. Macromolecules form organelles, which are microscopic \nstructures found within cells.\n The cellular level consists of cells, which are the smallest \nliving structures and serve as the basic units of structure and func\ntion in organisms. Cells and their components are formed from the \natoms and molecules from the chemical level. The structures of cells \nvary widely, reflecting the specializations needed for their different \nfunctions. For example, a skeletal muscle cell may be very long and \ncontain numerous organized protein filaments that aid in muscle \ncontraction, whereas a simple squamous epithelial cell (found in the \nlung air sac lining) is small and flattened to allow for efficient diffu\nsion of respiratory gases.\n Groups of similar cells with a common function form the next \nstage in the hierarchy, the tissue level. Tissues are precise orga\nnizations of similar cells that perform specialized functions. The \nfour types of tissues and their general roles in the human body are \n(1) epithelial tissue (covers exposed surfaces and lines body cavities); \n(2) connective tissue (protects, supports, and interconnects body parts \nand organs); (3) muscle tissue (produces movement); and (4) nervous \ntissue (conducts impulses for internal communication).\n At the organ level, different tissue types combine to form an \norgan, such as the small intestine, brain, lungs, stomach, or heart. \nOrgans contain two or more tissue types that work  together to per\nform specific, complex functions. The small intestine, for example, \nhas different structural and organizational relationships within its \ntissues that work together to process and absorb digested nutrients. \nThus, the small intestine shown in figure 1.3 exhibits all four tissue \ntypes: an internal lining composed of simple columnar epithelium; \na connective tissue layer that attaches the epithelium to an external \nlayer of smooth muscle; and nervous  tissue that innervates the organ.\n The organ system level consists of related organs that work \ntogether to coordinate activities and achieve a common function. For \nexample, several organs of the respiratory system (nose, pharynx, \nand trachea) collaborate to clean, warm, humidify, and conduct air \nfrom the atmosphere to the gas exchange surfaces in the lungs. Then \nspecial air sacs in the lungs allow exchange to occur between the \nrespiratory gases from the atmosphere and the gases in the blood.\n The highest level of structural organization in the body is the \norganismal level. All body systems function interdependently in a \nsingle living human, the organism.\n The importance of the interrelationships among structural levels \nof organization in the body becomes apparent when considering the \ndevastating effects a gene mutation (the chemical level) may have on \nthe body (the organismal level). For example, a common consequence \nof a specific genetic mutation in an individual’s DNA is cystic fibro\nsis (see Clinical View 25.1: “Cystic Fibrosis” in section 25.1a). This \ndisorder results when a defective or abnormal region in a molecule \nof DNA affects the normal function of cells in certain body organs. \nThese cells are unable to transport salt across their membranes, thus \ndisrupting the normal salt and water balance in the fluid covering \nthese cells. Abnormal cellular function causes a corresponding failure \nin the functioning of the tissues composed of these abnormal cells, \nultimately resulting in aberrant activity in the organ housing these \ntissues as well. Organ failure has devastating effects on organ system \nactivities. It is apparent that as the structural level increases in com\nplexity, the effects of a deviance or disruption magnify.",

         "1 A First Look at Anatomy\n1.4 Precise Language of Anatomy\n1.4d Regional Anatomy\n----------\n\n The human body is partitioned into two main regions, called \nthe axial and appendicular regions. The axial (ak′s ē-ăl) region \nincludes the head, neck, and trunk; it forms the main vertical axis \nof the body. Our limbs, or appendages, attach to the body’s axis \nand make up the appendicular (ap′en-dik′ū-lăr) region. Several \nspecific terms are used to identify the anatomic areas within these \ntwo regions. Figure 1.8 and table 1.3 identify the major regional \nterms and some additional minor ones.\n\n\n### Table 1.3  Human Body Regions\n| Region Name           | Description                                                     | Region Name           | Description                                                      |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Abdominal region      | Inferior to the thorax (chest) and superior to the pelvic brim of the hip bones | Nasal region         | Nose                                                            |\n| Antebrachial region   | Forearm (portion of the upper limb between elbow and wrist)     | Occipital region     | Posterior aspect of the head                                    |\n| Antecubital region    | Anterior to the elbow;

However, a single motor \nneuron’s axon branches to innervate numerous different muscle fibers \nin a muscle. Thus, a motor unit is composed of a single motor neuron \nand all of the muscle fibers it controls (figure 10.10).\n A motor unit typically controls only some of the muscle fibers \nin an entire muscle. Most muscles have many motor units, which \nmeans that many motor neurons are needed to innervate an entire \nmuscle. Thus, a large muscle such as the biceps brachii of the arm has \nnumerous motor units, each controlling a portion of the total number \nof fibers in the muscle.\n An inverse relationship exists between the size of the motor \nunit and the degree of control provided. In general, the smaller the \nmotor unit, the finer the control. For example, because precise control \nis essential in the muscles that move the eye, motor neurons inner\nvating eye muscles may control only two or three muscle fibers. In \ncontrast, power- generating muscles in our lower limbs require less \nprecise control, so a single motor neuron controls several thousand \nindividual muscle fibers.\n When a motor unit is stimulated, all its fibers contract at the \nsame time. The total force exerted by the muscle depends upon \nthe number of activated motor units. If more motor units are acti\nvated or recruited, more muscle fibers contract and greater force \nis exerted. Movements that require less force need fewer activated \nmotor units. Thus, the force and precision of muscle movement \ncan be varied, depending upon how many muscle fibers and motor \nunits are activated.\n Muscle Tone and Contraction Types\n Some motor units are always active, even when a muscle is at rest. \nThese motor units produce tension but not enough tension to cause \nmovement. Muscle tone is the resting tension in a skeletal muscle. \nUsually, motor units are stimulated randomly so that the attached \ntendon maintains a constant tension, but individual muscle fibers are \nafforded some relaxation time. This resting muscle tone stabilizes the \nposition of bones and joints.\n As stimulation begins and then increases in an active muscle, \nthe fibers within the muscle begin to contract, generating tension in \nthe muscle. The two types of muscle contraction are isometric and \nisotonic (figure 10.11).\n During an isometric (ī′sō-met′rik; iso = same, metron = mea\nsure) contraction, the length of the muscle does not change because \nthe tension produced by this contracting muscle never exceeds the re\nsistance (load). For example, when a person tries to lift an extremely \nheavy object (such as picking up the back of a car off the ground), the \narm muscles are isometrically contracted. Tension is generated, but it \nis not great enough to move the load.\n In an isotonic (ī′sō-ton′ik; tonos = tension) contraction, the \ntension produced equals or is greater than the resistance, and then \nthe muscle fibers shorten, resulting in movement. An example of \nisotonic contraction occurs when a person lifts a grocery bag out \nof the car. The tension generated in the appropriate muscles equals \nthe load, and then the muscle fibers shorten. Most of the move\nments performed by individuals working out on weight machines \nproduce isotonic contractions. Isotonic contractions are of two \ntypes. Concentric contractions actively shorten a muscle, as when \nwe lift a baby from a crib. The load (weight of the baby) is less than \nthe maximum tension that can be generated by the muscles in the \narm; thus, the muscle shortens and the baby is raised up. Eccentric \ncontractions actively lengthen a muscle when we are placing  \nthe baby back into the crib. The muscles in our arm are active while \nlengthening as we lay the baby down gently rather than just letting \nher “fall” into the crib.\n Simply put, an isotonic contraction of the arm muscles allows \nyou to lift a book from the table, whereas an isometric contraction of \nthe arm muscles occurs when you push against a wall.",

         "1 A First Look at Anatomy\n1.2 Definition of Anatomy\n----------\n\n✓Learning Objectives\n 3. Explain the similarities and differences between anatomy and \nphysiology.\n 4. List the steps involved in the scientific method and explain how \nthe scientific method has been used in the fields of anatomy \nand physiology.\n 5. Describe microscopic anatomy and its subdivisions.\n 6. Define gross anatomy and compare and contrast its subdisciplines.\n\n Anatomy is the study of structure. The word anatomy is derived \nfrom Greek and means “to cut apart.” Anatomists, scientists who \nstudy anatomy, examine the relationships among parts of the body \nas well as the structure of individual organs. Often the anatomy of \nspecific body parts suggests their functions. The scientific discipline \nthat studies the function of body structures is called physiology. A \nspecial relationship exists between anatomy and physiology because \nstructure and function cannot be completely separated. The examples \nin table 1.1 illustrate the differences and the interrelationships \nbetween anatomy (structure) and physiology (function).\n Anatomists and physiologists are professionals who use the \nscientific method to explain and understand the workings of the body. \nThe scientific method refers to a systematic and rigorous process by \nwhich scientists: \n ■ Examine natural events (or phenomena) through observation.\n ■ Develop a hypothesis (possible explanation) for explaining these phenomena.\n ■ Experiment and test the hypothesis through the collection of data.\n ■ Determine if the data support the hypothesis, or if the \nhypothesis needs to be rejected or modified.\n For example, early anatomists and physiologists used the scien\ntific method to explain how blood circulates through the body. Today, \nwe continue to use the scientific method for a variety of topics, such \nas to understand how the brain stores memories or explain how can\ncer may spread throughout the body. \nThe discipline of anatomy is an extremely broad field that can \nbe divided into two general categories: microscopic anatomy and \ngross anatomy.\n\n### Table 1.1 Comparison of Anatomy and Physiology\n\n| **Organ(s)** | **How Anatomists Describe the Organ(s)** | **How Physiologists Describe the Organ(s)** |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Muscles of the thigh** | These muscles are composed of skeletal muscle tissue and receive innervation from somatic motor neurons. These muscles include the quadriceps femoris and the hamstrings, which are designed to extend and flex the knee, respectively. | The muscles of the thigh contract voluntarily via nerve impulses from somatic motor neurons. The muscles are designed to provide enough power to move the parts of the lower limbs while walking. |\n| **Small intestine** | The wall of the small intestine contains an innermost simple columnar epithelium, as well as two layers of smooth muscle: an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer. The smooth muscle cells are spindle-shaped and lack the striations seen in skeletal muscle. | The simple columnar epithelium is designed for absorption of nutrients from the small intestine. The two layers of muscle contract involuntarily to mix and move materials in the small intestine, thus assisting with mechanical digestion and absorption of nutrients. |\n| **Esophagus** | The esophageal wall is composed of an innermost nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, a middle layer of dense irregular connective tissue, and an outer layer of muscle tissue (which contains a mixture of skeletal and smooth muscle). | The esophageal wall epithelium is protective and helps withstand the abrasive activities associated with swallowing food. The mixture of skeletal and smooth muscle contracts sequentially to propel food toward the stomach. |\n| **Blood capillaries** | The blood capillary wall is composed of a thin simple squamous epithelium. Some types of capillary walls also have fenestrations (openings) between the epithelial cells. | The thin structure of the blood capillary walls promotes nutrient, gas, and waste exchange between the blood and the surrounding tissues. Fenestrated capillaries are designed to allow for additional substance exchange. |\n\n\n WHAT DID YOU LEARN?\n ● 3 What is the relationship between anatomy and physiology?\n ● 4 What are some of the subdisciplines of gross anatomy?",

The articulating surfaces are enclosed within a capsule, \nand the bones are also joined by various ligaments.\n Joints also are classified functionally based upon the extent of \nmovement they permit:\n ■ A synarthrosis (sin′ar-thrō′sis; pl., sin′ar-thrō′sēz; syn = \njoined together, osis = condition) is an immobile joint. Two \ntypes of fibrous joints and one type of cartilaginous joint are \nsynarthroses.\n ■ An amphiarthrosis (am′fē-ar-thrō′sis; pl., -sēz; amphi = \naround) is a slightly mobile joint. One type of fibrous joint and \none type of cartilaginous joint are amphiarthroses.\n ■ A diarthrosis (dī′ar-thrō′sis; pl., -sēz; di = two) is a freely \nmobile joint. All synovial joints are diarthroses.\n The following discussion of articulations is based upon their struc\ntural classification, with functional categories included as appropriate. \nAs you read about the various types of joints, it may help you to refer \nto the summary of joint classifications in table 9.1.\n\n### Table 9.1  Joint Classifications\n| **Structural Classification** | **General Structural Characteristics** | **Structural Categories** | **Example(s)** | **Functional Classification** |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Fibrous** | Dense regular connective tissue holds bones together; no joint cavity | Gomphosis | Periodontal membranes hold tooth to bony jaw | Synarthrosis (immobile) |\n| | | Suture | Lambdoid suture (connects occipital and parietal bones) | Synarthrosis (immobile) |\n| | | Syndesmosis | Interosseous membrane between radius & ulna, tibia & fibula | Amphiarthrosis (slightly mobile) |\n| **Cartilaginous** | Pad of cartilage wedged between ends of bones; no joint cavity | Synchondrosis | Epiphyseal plates in growing bones; costochondral joints | Synarthrosis (immobile) |\n| | | Symphysis | Pubic symphysis; intervertebral disc articulations | Amphiarthrosis (slightly mobile) |\n| **Synovial** | Ends of bones covered with articular cartilage; joint cavity separates articulating bones; joint enclosed by articular capsule lined by synovial membrane; contains synovial fluid | **Uniaxial** | Plane joint: Intercarpal joints, intertarsal joints<br>Hinge joint: Elbow, knee, IP joints<br>Pivot joint: Atlantoaxial joint | Diarthrosis (freely mobile) |\n| | | **Biaxial** | Condylar joint: MP joints<br>Saddle joint: Carpometacarpal joint of thumb | Diarthrosis (freely mobile) |\n| | | **Multiaxial (triaxial)** | Ball-and-socket joint: Glenohumeral joint, hip joint | Diarthrosis (freely mobile) |\n",

         "8 Appendicular Skeleton\n8.6 Development of the Appendicular Skeleton\n----------\n\n ✓Learning Objective\n 16. Describe the events that occur during development of the \nappendicular skeleton.\n As mentioned in section 6.4, bone forms by either intramembranous \nossification or endochondral ossification. Many of the bones of the \nskull are formed from intramembranous ossification, whereas almost \nall of the remaining bones of the skeleton form through endochondral \nossification. (The exception is the clavicle, which is formed from a \ncentral intramembranous ossification center; its ends are formed from \nendochondral ossification centers.)\n The appendicular skeleton begins to develop during the fourth \nweek, when limb buds appear as small ridges along the lateral sides \nof the embryo. The upper limb buds appear early in the fourth week \n(about day 26), and the lower limb buds appear a few days later \n(day 28) (figure 8.16). In general, the development of upper and lower \nlimbs is similar. However, upper limb development precedes cor\nresponding lower limb development by about 2 to 4 days. The upper  \nand lower limbs form proximodistally, meaning that the more proxi\nmal parts of the limbs form first (in weeks 4–5), and the more distal \nparts differentiate later.\n Early limb buds are composed of lateral plate mesoderm and \ncovered by a layer of ectoderm. The lateral plate mesoderm later forms \nthe bones, tendons, cartilage, and connective tissue of the limb, while \nthe ectoderm forms the epidermis and the epidermal derivatives. The \nmusculature of the limbs forms from somitic  mesoderm that migrates \nto the developing limbs during the fifth week of development.\n At the apex of each limb bud, part of the ectoderm forms an \nelevated thickening called the apical ectodermal (ek′tō-dĕr′măl) \nridge, which plays a role in the differentiation and elongation of the \nlimb. By mechanisms not completely understood, this ridge “signals” \nthe underlying tissue to form the various components of the limb. \nExperiments on animals indicate that the limb fails to develop if the \napical ectodermal ridge is removed. Thus, this ridge is vital for limb \ndevelopment and differentiation.\n Initially, the limb buds are cylindrical. By the early fifth week, \nthe distal portion of the upper limb bud forms a rounded, paddle\nshaped hand plate, which later becomes the palm and fingers. In the \nlower limb bud, a corresponding foot plate forms during the sixth \nweek. These plates develop longitudinal thickenings called digital \nrays, which eventually form the digits. The digital rays in the hand \nplate appear in the late sixth week, and the foot digital rays appear \nduring the early seventh week. The digital rays are initially connected \nby intermediately placed tissue, which later undergoes programmed \ncell death (apoptosis). Thus, as this intermediate tissue dies, notching \noccurs between the digital rays, and separate digits are formed. This \nprocess occurs in the seventh week and is complete by the eighth \nweek for both the fingers and the toes.\n As the limb buds enlarge, bends appear where the future elbow \nand shoulder joints will develop. During the late seventh through \nearly eighth weeks, the upper limb rotates laterally, so that the elbows \nare directed posteriorly, while the lower limb rotates medially, so that \nthe knees are directed anteriorly. By week 8 of development, primary \nossification centers begin to form in each bone. Hyaline cartilage is \ngradually replaced by bony tissue via the process of endochondral os\nsification (see section 6.4b). By week 12, the shafts of the limb bones \nare rapidly ossifying, but other developing bones remain as cartilage. \nAll of these bones continue to develop throughout the fetal period \nand well into childhood.",

         "8 Appendicular Skeleton\n8.4 Lower Limb\n8.4a Femur\n----------\n\nThe femur (fē′mŭr; thigh) is the longest bone in the body as well as the \nstrongest and heaviest (figure 8.11). The nearly spherical head of the \nfemur articulates with the os coxae at the acetabulum. There is a small \ndepression within the head of the femur, called the fovea (fō′vē-ă; a \npit), or fovea capitis. Here a small ligament connects the head of the \nfemur to the acetabulum. Distal to the head, an elongated, constricted \nneck joins the shaft of the femur at an angle, which brings the knees \ncloser to the midline.\n\n Two massive, rough processes originate near the proximal end \nof the femur and serve as insertion sites for the powerful gluteal and \nthigh muscles. The greater trochanter (trō-kan′tĕr; a runner) pro\njects laterally from the junction of the neck and shaft. Stand up and \npalpate your lateral thigh, near the hip joint; the bony projection you \nfeel is the greater trochanter. A lesser trochanter is located on the \nfemur’s posteromedial surface. The greater and lesser  trochanters are \nconnected on the posterior surface of the femur by a thick oblique \nridge of bone called the intertrochanteric (in′tĕr-trō′kan-ter′ik) \ncrest. Anteriorly, a raised intertrochanteric line extends between \n the two trochanters and marks the distal edge of the hip joint capsule. \nInferior to the intertrochanteric crest, the pectineal line marks the \nattachment of the pectineus muscle, whereas the gluteal (glu ̆′tē-ăl; \ngloutos = buttock) tuberosity marks the attachment of the gluteus \nmaximus muscle (see section 12.2a).\n The prominent feature on the posterior surface of the shaft is \nan elevated, midline ridge called the linea aspera (lin′ē-ă as′pĕr-ă;  \nrough line). This ridge denotes the attachment site for many thigh \nmuscles. The gluteal tuberosity and pectineal line merge proximally \nto the linea aspera. Distally, the linea aspera branches into medial \nand lateral supracondylar lines. A flattened triangular area, called \nthe popliteal (pop-lit′ē-ăl; poples = ham of knee) surface, is bor\ndered by these ridges and an imaginary line between the distal epi\ncondyles. The medial supracondylar ridge terminates in the adductor \ntubercle, a rough, raised projection that is the site of attachment for \nthe adductor magnus muscle.\n On the distal, inferior surface of the femur are two smooth, \noval articulating surfaces called the medial and lateral condyles \n(kon′dīl). Superior to each condyle are projections called the medial \nand lateral epicondyle, respectively. When you flex your knee, you \ncan palpate these epicondyles in the thigh on the sides of your knee \njoint. The medial and lateral supracondylar lines terminate at these \nepicondyles. On the distal posterior surface of the femur, a deep \nintercondylar fossa separates the two condyles. Both condyles \ncontinue from the posterior surface to the anterior surface, where \ntheir articular faces merge, producing an articular surface with el\nevated lateral borders. This smooth anteromedial depression, called \nthe patellar surface, is the place where the patella articulates with \nthe femur.",

         "7 Axial Skeleton\n7.5 Thoracic Cage\n7.5b Ribs\n----------\n\nThe ribs are elongated, curved, flat bones that articulate (connect) with the \nthoracic vertebrae and end in the anterior wall of the thorax (figure 7.32). \nBoth males and females have the same number of ribs—12 pairs. Ribs 1–7 \nare called true ribs. At the anterior body wall, the true ribs articulate indi\nvidually to the sternum by separate cartilaginous extensions called costal \n(kos′tăl; costa = rib) cartilages. The smallest true rib is the first.\n Ribs 8–12 are called false ribs because their costal cartilages do \nnot attach directly to the sternum. The costal cartilages of ribs 8–10 \nfuse to the costal cartilage of rib 7 and thus indirectly articulate with \nthe sternum. The last two pairs of false ribs (ribs 11 and 12) are called \nfloating ribs because they have no connection with the sternum.\n The vertebral end of a typical rib articulates with the vertebral \ncolumn at the head (or capitulum). The articular surface of the head is di\nvided into superior and inferior articular facets by an interarticular crest \n(figure 7.33a). The surfaces of these facets articulate with the costal facets \non the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae. The neck of the rib lies between \nthe head and the tubercle. The tubercle (or tuberculum) of the rib has an \narticular facet for the costal facet on the transverse process of the thoracic \nvertebra. Figure 7.33b, c illustrates how most of the ribs articulate with the \nthoracic vertebrae. Rib 1 articulates with vertebra T1. The head of the rib \narticulates at a costal facet on the body, and the tubercle of the rib articu\nlates at a transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T1.\n Ribs 2–9 articulate with vertebrae T2–T9. Each of these verte\nbrae has two demifacets on the lateral side of its body. The superior \narticular facet on the head of the rib articulates with the more superior \nvertebra, and the inferior articular facet articulates with the more \ninferior vertebra. For example, the superior articular facet on the head \nof rib 2 articulates with the inferior costal demifacet on the body of T1, \nand the inferior articular facet on the head of rib 2 articulates with the \nsuperior costal demifacet on the body of T2. The tubercle of each rib \narticulates with the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of \nthe corresponding vertebra. For example, the tubercle of rib 3 articu\nlates with the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T3.\n Ribs 10–12 articulate with vertebrae T10–T12. Each of these ver\ntebrae has a whole costal facet on the lateral body to articulate with \nthe head of its respective rib. Vertebra T10 also has transverse costal \nfacets on its transverse processes to articulate with the tubercle of each  \nrib 10. Ribs 11 and 12 do not have tubercles, so there are no costal \nfacets on the transverse processes of T11 and T12.\n The angle (border) of the rib indicates the site where the tubular \nshaft (or body) begins curving anteriorly toward the  sternum. A promi\nnent costal groove along its inferior internal border marks the path of in\ntercostal nerves and blood vessels to the thoracic wall (see section 16.4c).\n",

Several large projections extend from the scapula and \nprovide surface area for muscle and ligament attachments. The spine \nof the scapula is a ridge of bone on the posterior aspect of the scapula. \nIt is easily palpated under the skin. The spine is continuous with a \nlarger, flattened, posterior process called the acromion (ă-krō′mē-on; \nakron = tip, omos = shoulder), which forms the bony tip of the shoul\nder. Palpate the superior region of your shoulder; the prominent bump \nyou feel is the acromion. The acromion articulates with the acromial \nend of the clavicle. The coracoid (kōr′ă-koyd; korakodes = like a \ncrow’s beak) process is the smaller, more anterior projection.\n The triangular shape of the scapula forms three sides, or bor\nders. The superior border is the horizontal edge of the scapula su\nperior to the spine of the scapula; the medial border (also called the \nvertebral border) is the edge of the scapula closest to the  vertebrae; \n and the lateral border (also called the axillary border) is closest to \nthe axilla (armpit). A conspicuous suprascapular notch (which in \nsome individuals is a suprascapular foramen) in the superior border \nprovides passage for the suprascapular nerve.\n Between these borders are the superior, inferior, and lateral \nangles. The superior angle is the pointed part of the scapula be\ntween the superior and medial borders, whereas the inferior angle \nis located between the medial and lateral borders. The lateral angle \nis composed primarily of the cup-shaped, shallow glenoid (glē′noyd; \nresembling a socket) cavity, or glenoid fossa, which articulates  \nwith the humerus, the bone of the arm. Tubercles (tū′bĕr-kĕl) on the \nsuperior and inferior edges of the glenoid cavity serve as attachment \nsites for the muscles that position the shoulder and arm. Near the \nsuperior edge of the glenoid cavity is the supraglenoid tubercle, and \nnear the inferior edge is the infraglenoid tubercle.\n\n The scapula has several flattened regions of bone that provide \nsurfaces for the attachment of some of the rotator cuff muscles, which \nhelp stabilize and move the shoulder joint. The broad, relatively \nsmooth, anterior surface of the scapula is called the subscapular \n(sŭb-skap′yū-lăr; sub = under) fossa (fos′ă; pl.,  fossae, fos′ē). It is \nslightly concave and relatively featureless. A large muscle called the \nsubscapularis overlies this fossa. The spine subdivides the posterior \nsurface of the scapula into two shallow depressions, or fossae. The \ndepression superior to the spine is the supraspinous (sū′pră-spı ̄′nŭs; \nsupra = above) fossa; inferior to the spine is a broad, extensive sur\nface called the infraspinous fossa. The supraspinatus and infraspi\nnatus muscles, respectively, attach in these fossae (see section 12.1b)",

Specifically, research has indicated that chronic UV \nray exposure can mutate the p53 gene in normal skin.  This gene, when \nmutated, has been identified as a risk factor in many cancers (including \nskin cancer).  Thus, UV overexposure is the predominant factor in the de\nvelopment of nearly all skin cancers. Skin cancer is the most common type \nof cancer. It occurs most frequently on the head and neck regions, followed \nby other regions commonly exposed to the sun. Fair-skinned individuals, \n137\n especially those who experienced severe sunburns as children, are most at \nrisk for skin cancer. However, skin cancer can arise in anyone of any age. \nIndividuals should use sunscreen regularly and avoid prolonged exposure \nto the sun (see Clinical View 5.2: “UV Radiation, Sunscreens, and Sunless \nTanners” in section 5.2b). An individual should regularly and thoroughly \ninspect his or her skin for any changes, such as an increase in the number \nor size of moles or the appearance of new skin lesions. In addition, an \nexamination by a dermatologist should be part of everyone’s routine health \ncheckup. Table 5.4 describes the three main types of skin cancer.\n\n### Table 5.4 Skin Cancer\n| **Skin Cancer Type**       | **Key Information** |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Basal Cell Carcinoma**    | • Most common type of skin cancer<br>• Least dangerous because it seldom metastasizes<br>• Originates in the **stratum basale**<br>• First appears as a small, pearly white or pink shiny elevation with small blood vessels; may enlarge and develop central depression with pearly edge<br>• Usually occurs on the face<br>• Treated by **surgical removal** of lesion |\n| **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** | • Arises from **keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum**<br>• Lesions usually appear on scalp, ears, lower lip, or back of hand<br>• Early lesions are raised, reddened, scaly; later form concave ulcers with elevated edges<br>• Treated by **surgical removal** of lesion<br>• May metastasize |\n| **Malignant Melanoma**      | • **Most deadly** skin cancer due to aggressive growth and metastasis<br>• Arises from **melanocytes**, usually in a preexisting mole<br>• Risk increased with severe childhood sunburns<br>• Characterized by changes in mole diameter, color, border shape, and symmetry<br>• Early detection and surgical removal improves survival<br>• Advanced cases are difficult to cure; treated with chemotherapy, interferon therapy, and radiation |\n\nThe usual signs of melanoma may be easily remembered using the ABCDE rule. Report any of the following changes in a \nbirthmark or mole to your physician if you see any of the ABCDE characteristics, described below:\n| **Letter** | **Meaning** | **Description** |\n|-------------|---------------|------------------|\n| **A** | Asymmetry | One-half of a mole or birthmark does not match the other. |\n| **B** | Border | Edges are notched, irregular, blurred, or ragged. |\n| **C** | Color | Color is not uniform; may include shades of brown, black, white, blue, or red. |\n| **D** | Diameter | Larger than 6 mm (¼ inch) or increasing in size. |\n| **E** | Evolving | Changing in size, shape, or color, or changes in symptoms such as itchiness, tenderness, surface changes, or bleeding. |\n",
